Objective To check the prices, availability, and affordability of the World Health Organization (WHO) key access antibiotics in private sector pharmacies of Lahore, Pakistan. Methodology A survey of WHO key access antibiotics from WHO essential medicine list 2017 was conducted in private sector pharmacies of 4 different regions of Lahore employing adapted WHO/HAI methodology. The comparison of prices and availability between originator brands (OB) and lowest price generics (LPG) were conducted followed by the effect of medicine price differences on patient’s affordability. The data were analyzed using a preprogrammed WHO Microsoft excel workbook. Results The mean availability of OB products was 45.20% and the availability of LPGs was 40.40%. The OBs of co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin and metronidazole and LPGs of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were easily available (100%) in all private sector pharmacies. Whereas, antibiotics like chloramphenicol, cloxacillin, nitrofurantoin, spectinomycin, and cefazolin were totally unavailable in all the surveyed pharmacies. The OBs and LPGs with high MPRs were ceftriaxone (OB; 15.31, LPG; 6.38) and ciprofloxacin (OB; 12.42, LPG; 5.77). The median of brand premium obtained was 38.7%, which varied between the lowest brand premium of 3.97% for metronidazole and highest for ceftriaxone i.e. 140%. The cost of standard treatment was 0.5\\xa0day’s wage (median) if using OB and 0.4\\xa0day’s wage (median) for LPG, for a lowest paid unskilled government worker. Treatment with OB and LPG was unaffordable for ciprofloxacin (OB; 2.4, LPG; 1.1) & cefotaxime (OB; 12.7, LPG; 8.1). Conclusion There is dire need to properly implement price control policies to better regulate fragile antibiotic supply system so that the availability of both OB and LPG of key access antibiotics should be increased. The prices could be reduced by improving purchasing efficiency, excluding taxes and regulating mark-ups. This could increase the affordability of patients to complete their antibiotic therapy with subsequent reduction in antimicrobial resistance.', 'venue': 'Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation', 'year': 2021, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12962-021-00263-x', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7885400, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are concerns that unavailability and high prices of cancer medicines may limit patient access. Since information on availability, prices and affordability for cancer medicine is lacking for several countries, particularly for lower income countries like Ethiopia, it will be difficult to know the real situation of those medications' access. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess availability, affordability and price of anti-cancer medications, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods The study was cross-sectional using a modified form of the WHO/HAI methodology of measuring medicine price, availability and affordability in public, private, Kenema municipal and Red Cross Pharmacies found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on the availability and price of 47 cytotoxic medications for both lowest priced generics and originator brands were collected in 3 public, 6 private and 2 NGO pharmacies which are expected to dispense cytotoxic medications in Addis Ababa. The data were entered and analyzed using WHO/HAI data entry and analysis form. Results were presented in tables and figures. Results The majority of the anti-cancer medications assessed were not available and the few available medicines were unaffordable. The lowest priced generic were relatively more available (34.8%) than the originator brand medications (2.8%) in the public sector. Generally, the availability of anti-cancer medicine differs when comparing the public, private and other sectors. The availability of cytotoxic medications was 18.8%, 5.3% and 8.8% in the public, private and other sectors. The prices of cytotoxic medications available in the private sector were higher than the public and other sectors. All of the medications except for anastrazole were unaffordable. Conclusion Medicines for cancer treatment are unavailable and the few available medicines are unaffordable in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Different interventions should be done to improve access to cytotoxic medications.\", 'venue': 'Risk Management and Healthcare Policy', 'year': 2022, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=86472', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9807119, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In order to introduce transparency in the private market the government introduced the Single Exit Price (SEP) for medicines in 2004, for all prescription medicines, comprising of a fixed ex-factory price with a logistics fee component (and value added tax) for medicines sold to all purchasers other than the State. This is complemented with a provision for an annual regulated maximum percentage increase. The study evaluates the impact of the SEP on a basket of originator medicines, in terms of costs, immediate price reductions and projected price reductions.MethodThis is an analytical, quantitative study. A basket of medicines was selected, based on the WHO/HAI list, and adapted to include registered medicines in South Africa. Prices of 50 originator medicines were assessed from 1999 to 2014 in terms of the single exit price and the changes in prices in accordance with legislation using a time series analysis methodology.ResultsOf the 50 originator medicines investigated 35 showed a statistically significant change in level. For the Global Core list, the percentage change ranged from 2.45–39.12% (mean\\u2009=\\u200919.87%, SD\\u2009=\\u200910.62%, IQR\\u2009=\\u200910.2%). The range for the Regional Core list was 1.77–42.17% (mean\\u2009=\\u200923.38%, SD\\u2009=\\u200912.43%, IQR\\u2009=\\u200915.65%).

This study indicates that the SEP regulation had an impact on medicine pricing in South Africa in both the short and long term. Most medicines investigated showed a smaller yearly increase in price compared to before regulations due to the controlled pricing environment introduced by Government.ConclusionThis study provides evidence of the impact of medicine pricing intervention from a middle–income country, and other developing countries looking at introducing medicine price controls can draw useful lessons.', 'venue': 'BMC Health Services Research', 'year': 2019, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4403-8', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6697979, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Yet, because of increasing demands, many governments are now facing the dilemma of making essential cancer medicines available to all while keeping them affordable. Precise information about current access to these medicines is limited, and there's no systematic methodology in place to do so. Aim: To assess the availability and affordability of essential cancer medicines in Mexico, and compare their prices (public sector procurement and patient prices) against those in other countries of the region. Methods: We adapted the WHO/HAI methodology. We surveyed 21 public hospitals and 19 private pharmacies in 8 states of Mexico. Data were collected on the availability and prices of 49 essential cancer medicines (each strength and dose-form specific). Prices were compared against those in Chile, Peru, Brazil, Colombia and PAHO's Strategic Fund. Results: Of the various medicines, mean availability in public and private sector outlets was 61.2% and 67.5%, respectively. In the public sector, medicines covered by the public health insurance “People's Health Insurance” (SPS) were slightly more available. Only 7 (public sector) and 5 (private sector) out of 49 medicines were deemed affordable. Overall, public sector procurement prices were 41% lower than in other countries of the region. Conclusion: The availability of essential cancer medicines, in the public and private sector, falls below WHO's 80% target. The affordability remains suboptimal as well. A national health insurance scheme could serve as a mechanism to improve access to cancer medicines in the public sector. Comprehensive pricing policies are warranted to improve the affordability of cancer medicines in the private sector.\", 'venue': 'Journal of Global Oncology', 'year': 2018, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1200/jgo.18.88900', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1200/JGO.18.88900?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1200/JGO.18.88900, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Access to essential medicines for children is a big challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Our study aimed to assess the accessibility of essential medicines for children in public sector in Sichuan Province of China, based on availability, affordability, and price. Methods: We adopted the modified World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardization methodology to measure the availability, affordability, and prices of 30 essential medicines for children in 20 public hospitals in nine regions of the Sichuan Province, China. Availability was expressed as the percentage of public medicine outlets that stocked surveyed medicines on the day of data collection, and prices were expressed as median price ratio (MPR). Affordability was assessed as the number of Sichuan Province’s daily wages required for the lowest-paid government unskilled worker (11.03 USD per day) to purchase one standard treatment of an acute disease or treatment for chronic disease for a month. Results: The mean availability of originator brands (OBs) and lowest priced generics (LPGs) were 9.7 and 46.5% in public sector. MPRs of only 3 OBs could be calculated, ranging from 0.55 to 13.37. MPRs of 18 LPGs ranged from 0.07 to 25.05. Among them, 2 OBs and 11 LPGs were priced at more than 1.5 times their international reference prices (IRPs) in public sector, most of which were injections. Except for cefazolin injection and ceftriaxone injection, most LPGs were affordable for the treatment of childhood diseases in public sector, as they each cost one or less than the daily wage for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. Conclusions: Although the availability of LPGs for children was higher than OBs in public sector, the availability of children’s essential medicines was low in surveyed public sector in Sichuan Province, which was similar to previous studies in other provinces of China. The price of most medicines surveyed was higher than their IRPs in surveyed public sector, especially for some injections. The affordability of most surveyed LPGs was reasonable in surveyed public sector, except for ceftriaxone injection and cefazolin injection.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Pharmacology', 'year': 2022, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.828152/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8888852, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Overall a total of 83 public facilities, 68 primary care, 10 secondary cares and 5 tertiary care facilities were surveyed. Data was also collected from private retail (n\\u2009=\\u200940) and chain pharmacies (n\\u2009=\\u200940) of a leading corporate house. Prices were compared to an international reference price (expressed as median price ratio-MPR).ResultsPublic sector: Delhi state government has its essential medicine list (Delhi state EML) and was using Delhi state EML 2007 for procurement; the other two agencies had their own procurement list. All the antibiotics procured including second and third generation antibiotics except for injections were available at primary care facilities. Antibiotic available were on the basis of supply rather than rationality or the Delhi state EML and none was 100% available. There was sub-optimal availability of some essential antibiotics while other non-essential ones were freely available. Availability of antibiotics at tertiary care facilities was also sub-optimal. Private sector: Availability of antibiotics was good. For most of the antibiotics the most expensive and popular trade names were often available. High-end antibiotics, meropenam, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin were commonly available. In retail pharmacies some newer generation non-essential antibiotics like gemifloxacin were priced lower than the highest-priced generic of amoxicillin\\u2009+\\u2009clavulanic acid, azithromycin, and cefuroxime aexitl.ConclusionsInappropriate availability and pricing of newer generation antibiotics, which may currently be bought without prescription, is likely to lead to their over-use and increased resistance.

This study aims to explore the government interventions on medicine pricing in Thailand. Methods: Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research included a literature review and a cross-sectional survey of medicine prices using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Data were collected from both public and private sectors across six provinces in Thailand during April–May 2023. Additionally, international price comparisons were conducted with countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Results: The research identified a significant reduction in the median price ratios (MPRs) of medicines, closer alignment of prices with international benchmarks, and decreased variability in pricing between regions and sectors. These changes illustrated the positive effects of Thailand’s pricing policies implemented over the past 16 years. Conclusions: The strategic interventions implemented by the Thai government have markedly enhanced the regulation and affordability of medicine prices. However, to sustain these achievements and ensure the viability of the local pharmaceutical industry, ongoing efforts and policy adaptations are essential. This study emphasises the critical need for continuous evaluation of these policies to respond effectively to evolving healthcare and economic conditions.', 'venue': 'Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice', 'year': 2025, 'isOpenAccess': False, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852222, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Design Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken before and after the launch of NDPP 2018, using a modified WHO/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Setting Four districts of Lahore division, Pakistan. Participants 16 public sector hospitals and 16 private sector retail pharmacies. Measures The pre and post survey data on prices and availability of lowest price generics (LPGs) and originator brands (OBs) of 50 medicines were obtained by visiting the same public and private sector health facilities (n=32). Out of 50, 46 surveyed medicines were from the National Essential Medicines List. Inflation-adjusted median unit prices (MUPs) and median price ratios (MPRs) from 2019 were used for price comparison. Affordability was calculated in terms of number of days’ wages required to get a standard treatment by the lowest paid unskilled government worker. Results The overall mean percent availabilities remained poor in both years, that is, far less than 80%. In the public sector, the mean percent availability of OBs improved from 6.8% to 33.1%, whereas, in the case of LPGs, it was reduced from 35.1% to 9%. In the private sector, the mean percent availability of both OBs and LPGs demonstrated slight improvements in 2019, that is, 55.0%–58.3% and 20.3%–32.3%. The adjusted MUPs and MPRs of OBs significantly increased by a median of 4.29% (Wilcoxon test p=0.001, p=0.0001), whereas the adjusted MUPs and MPRs of LPGs increased by a median of 15.7% (p=0.002, p=0.0002). Overall, the affordability of many medicines for common ailments was reduced significantly in 2019. Conclusions The availability of medicines slightly improved, except in the case of LPGs, which was reduced in the public sector. The implementation of NDPP 2018 led to increase in drug prices, making the standard treatment for some of the most prevalent ailments unaffordable.

When lifestyle modifications prove insufficient, medication becomes a cornerstone in controlling such diseases and saving lives. Price, availability, and affordability hinder the equitable access to medicines. The study aimed to assess prices, availability, and affordability of essential cardiovascular disease medicines in relation to pricing strategies in Qatar and Lebanon.MethodsA cross-sectional survey using a variant of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology as outlined in “Measuring medicine prices, availability, affordability and price components” (2008), second edition, was adopted. Prices and availability of 27 cardiovascular medicines were collected from public and private dispensing outlets. For international comparison, prices were adjusted to purchasing power parity. Data was analyzed across multiple sectors, within and across countries.ResultsA total of 15 public and private outlets were surveyed in each country. Prices were more uniform in Qatar than in Lebanon. In the public sector, medicines were free-of-charge in Lebanon and priced lower than the international reference prices in Qatar. The ratio of medicine unit price to international reference price in the private sectors surveyed are significantly higher than the acceptable threshold of 4. This ratio of originator brands and lowest priced generics in Qatar were up to two and five times those in Lebanon, respectively, even after adjusting for purchasing power parity. However, prices of lowest priced generics in the private sector were at least 35% cheaper in Qatar and 65% cheaper in Lebanon than their comparative originator brands. Medicines were more available in the private sector in Lebanon than in Qatar, but only the originator brand availability in the public sector in Qatar exceeded the WHO target of more than 80%. While affordable in the public sector in Qatar, four out of thirteen medicines exceeded the threshold in all private sectors covered. Hence, only the public sector in Qatar had a satisfying level of availability and affordability.ConclusionsExcept for the Qatari public sector, medicine prices, availability, and affordability are falling short from targets.

Diabetes require a long-term therapy, which incurs significant health care cost and thus impact access and affordability. This study aims to assess the availability, prices, and affordability of four essential medicines used to treat diabetes in private primary care pharmacies in 17 countries. Methods: Data on affordability, availability, and prices of four essential diabetes medicines from 51 primary care pharmacies across 17 countries were obtained using a variation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. The surveyed countries were Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, China, Jordan, Russia, Armenia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Georgia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Tanzania. International reference prices and daily income of the lowest-paid unskilled government workers were used as comparators. The prices were converted into US$ using both foreign exchange rates and purchasing power parity. We compared patterns of affordability and availability and prices of innovator brand (IB) and lowest priced generic (LPG) of diabetes medicines by WHO regional groupings and by country level. Results: Lowest priced generic of metformin 500 mg had the highest total mean availability (≥80%) among all the surveyed medicines. The total mean availability of insulin 100 IU/ml was only 36.21% (IBs and LPGs), where IB was more frequently available than LPG (50% vs. 26%) across 17 surveyed countries. Patients would have to spend more to procure 1-month’s supply of IB of insulin in low-income than patients in high-income countries (no. of day’s wages: 2.37 vs. 0.46, p = 0.038). For the majority of the surveyed countries the median price-ratio was less than 3. The highest PPP-adjusted prices for 30-day treatment with IB of insulin 100 IU/ml and metformin 500 mg were highest in Bangladesh ($80.21) and Tanzania ($4334.17), respectively.

To help address this issue, we evaluated the availability, affordability and price of insulin products in Nanjing, eastern China. Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in 2016 and 2018. A total of 56 hospital pharmacies were sampled, using a simplified and adapted World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Prices were expressed as Median Price Ratios (MPRs) to Australian Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) prices. In addition, we investigated the price components of seven selected insulin products as a case study before and after the Online Centralized Procurement Policy for Hospital Drugs in May, 2018. Affordability was presented as the number of daily wages of the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) required to purchase 1000IU of insulin based on the average courses of treatment, approximately 30 days’ treatment. The availability of insulin products was very high in secondary hospitals and tertiary hospitals both in 2016 and 2018, but in community hospitals was very low. In 2018, the availability of prandial insulin products showed fluctuation compared to 2016. The availability of pre-mixed human insulin products was over 95% overall, and also very high (80%) in community hospitals in 2018. The prices of insulin products were much lower than PBS prices of Australian in this study, with the MPRs less than 1 (0.32 to 0.71 in 2016 vs. 0.30 to 0.68 in 2018) for all insulin types. But insulin products in Nanjing in 2016 and 2018 were considered unaffordable, because the number of daily wages of the LPGW needed to purchase for the 30 days treatment of insulin products ranged from 2.26 to 8.49 in 2016 and 1.88 to 7.09 in 2018.

Performing comparative analysis of drug prices in 2011 and 2015 in Kazan to assess the effectiveness of state initiatives to ensure the affordability of medicines. Methods. The collection and processing of data was performed according to methodology developed by Health Action International and World Health Organization (WHO/HAI). We studied the availability and prices of 30 medicines in public and private pharmacies in Kazan in 2011 and 2015 and analyzed the procurement prices of the same medicines in inpatient hospitals. Recording and analysis were performed using standardized MS Excel WHO/HAI Workbook. Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices and were expressed as median price ratio. Results. The analysis showed a decrease in medicine prices in 2015 compared to 2011. In public and private sectors median price ratio of the originator brands reduced by about 3 times, and of the lowest price generics reduced by 1.5 times. A decrease in procurement prices by more than 2 times for generics and more than 6 times for the original brands was also revealed in 2015 in comparison with 2011. Conclusion. State initiatives to regulate drug prices contributed to the price reduction by 1.5-3 times in 2015 compared to 2011; changes in the procedures for the medicines procurement at the legislative level resulted in reduction of procurement prices by more than 2 times for generic drugs in 2015 compared to 2011.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2017, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://kazanmedjournal.ru/kazanmedj/article/download/7042/5658', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17750/KMJ2017-822?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17750/KMJ2017-822, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Dentists prescribe analgesics and antibiotic prophylaxis apart from routine dental treatments. The increasing costs of medications are a major factor that adds to the financial burden of patients seeking oral care. Methods A list of antibiotics and analgesics recommended by the American Dental Association for dental pain, swelling, and post-procedural pain management was analyzed for the cost variation and cost ratio. The affordability was calculated by the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO-HAI) methodology. The most expensive and the least expensive brands of all drug regimens were compared. Results Wide cost variations were observed between the different brands of antibiotics and analgesics. The highest cost variation was found in ampicillin 500 mg injection (13579.2%). In the affordability analysis; when the most expensive brands were analyzed, the lowest-paid unskilled worker had to lose 2.1 days of wages to afford the drug regimen. The price range was widest for injection ampicillin 500 mg (Rs. 4.24-580.0) and lowest for tablet ibuprofen 400 mg (Rs. 0.7-1.6). Conclusion Dental surgeons need to be well aware of the pharmacoeconomics behind medications that directly decides the affordability of treatments. Careful selection of drugs by the dentists considering their quality, availability, and costs is of pivotal importance. Prescribing generic medications and increasing the availability of drugs in public health sectors can help provide cost-effective dental care for all.', 'venue': 'Cureus', 'year': 2022, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/80773/20220302-25537-layzt.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8889376, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To conduct a comparative analysis of medicine prices in 2017 and 2018 years in Kazan (The Republic of Tatarstan, The Russian Federation) to assess the effectiveness of government measures to ensure the accessibility of medicines. Methods. We conducted a comparative analysis of medicine prices according to methodology developed by Health Action International and World Health Organization (WHO/HAI). The analysis included 30 medicines at a preselected dosage form. We studied the accessibility and prices of original brands and lowest priced generic of each medicine in the public and private pharmacies of Kazan in 2017 and 2018, and analyzed the procurement prices of the same medicines in inpatient hospitals. Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices (The Management Sciences for Health (MSH) reference prices) and expressed as median price ratio (MPR). Results. Prices for originator and generic medicines in the public and private sectors tended to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017, but statistically significant price reduction occurred only for generic medicines in the private sector. For example, the median price ratio for originator products changed from 6.86 to 2.97 in the public sector and from 11.1 to 5.36 in the private sector in 2018 compared to 2017, but the changes were not statistically significant (p >0.05). Prices for generics medicines in the public sector did not change in the studied years and remained at the level of international reference prices (the median price ratio were 1.3 in 2017 and 1.27 in 2018). In the private sector, we found a twofold decrease in the prices of generics medicines in 2018 compared to 2017 [the median price ratio decreased from 3.25 to 1.44 (p <0.05)]. Procurement prices for generics medicines in public hospitals in 2017 and 2018 years did not show statistically significant changes with the median price ratio equal to 1.34 and 0.8, respectively.

The aim of this pilot study was to scope availability, price and affordability of essential cardiovascular medicines for children in selected states in Nigeria. The study was a descriptive longitudinal survey conducted in three phases. Availability was determined as percentage of facilities having the medicine on the survey date. Medicines with good availability (>80%) were noted. Prices were cross-referenced against international Reference Prices and the Nigerian National Health Insurance Scheme Prices. Affordability was calculated using the Least-Paid Government Worker method. For medicines compounded to improve availability, a model for calculating affordability was proposed. In Phase I, the availability of all 17 strengths of the cardiovascular medicines or diuretics listed in the Essential Medicines List for Children (2015) were surveyed in two conveniently selected states using the WHO/HAI questionnaire. Data were collected from 17 hospitals and pharmacies. Phases II and III focused on tablet formulations (enalapril, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone) in three purposively selected state capitals: Lagos, Abuja and Yenagoa. In Phase II, 11 private pharmacies were surveyed in December 2016: Phase III tracked price changes in Abuja and Yenagoa in August 2018. Only furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide tablets had good availability. Oral liquids were unavailable. Prices for four generic oral tablets were 2–16× higher than the International Reference Prices; prices for two of these did not change significantly over the study period. Affordable medicines were generic furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide tablet. Where a fee is charged, compounded medicines were also not affordable. While the small sample sizes limit generalization, this study provides indicative data suggesting that prices for cardiovascular medicines remain high and potentially unaffordable in the private sector in these selected states, and when compounded.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Since the year 2008, the Global Fund has rolled out several funding streams for malaria control in Uganda. Among these are mechanisms aimed at increasing the availability and affordability of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). This paper examines the availability and affordability of first-line malaria treatment and diagnostics in the private sector, which is the preferred first point of contact for 61% of households in Uganda between 2007 and 2018. Methods Cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 2007 and 2018, based on a standardized World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology adapted to assess availability, patient prices, and affordability of ACT medicines in private retail outlets. A minimum of 30 outlets were surveyed per year as prescribed by the standardized methodology co-developed by the WHO and Health Action International. Availability, patient prices, and affordability of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was also tracked from 2012 following the rollout of the test and treat policy in 2010. The median patient prices for the artemisinin-based combinations and RDTs was calculated in US dollars (USD). Affordability was assessed by computing the number of days’ wages the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) had to pay to purchase a treatment course for acute malaria. Results Availability of artemether/lumefantrine (A/L), the first-line ACT medicine, increased from 85 to100% in the private sector facilities during the study period. However, there was low availability of diagnostic tests in private sector facilities ranging between 13% (2012) and 37% (2018). There was a large reduction in patient prices for an adult treatment course of A/L from USD 8.8 in 2007 to USD 1.1 in 2018, while the price of diagnostics remained mostly stagnant at USD 0.5. The affordability of ACT medicines and RDTs was below one day’s wages for LPGW. Conclusions Availability of ACT medicines in the private sector medicines retail outlets increased to 100% while the availability of diagnostics remained low. Although malaria treatment was affordable, the price of diagnostics remained stagnant and increased the cumulative cost of malaria management.

Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted in Dessie town from November 2018 to February 2019. A standard checklist adapted from the Logistics Indicator Assessment Tool and WHO/HAI was used to collecting data on the availability, affordability, and price of 45 priority life-saving medicines from eight public health centers and two public hospitals. Descriptive statistics (percent and median) were computed for availability and prices. Affordability was reported in terms of the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. Results Twenty-two medicines were not found at all in public health facilities. The overall availability of WHO priority maternal and child medicines was 34.02%. The mean number of stock-outs was 3.9, and the mean number was 128.9\\u2009days. The mean average point availability was 33.5%, and 7 medicines stock out on the days of assessment. From WHO priority maternal and child medicines, 4 (40%) of the products were unaffordable and 5 (55.5%) had higher prices than international prices. Ceftriaxone 1\\u2009g, ceftriaxone 500\\u2009mg, and hydralazine 20\\u2009mg injection required wages of 6.58, 8.01, and 5.02 to cover specific maternal health problems respectively.

The South African government has passed price legislation prohibiting discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical sector by setting a single exit price for all manufacturers and a fee-for service logistics fee for wholesalers, distributors and dispensing fee for retailers as compensation. In this study the South African mark-up structure related to medicine prices is going to be analysed because of its tribulations in implementing a transparent wholesale reform and the fact that it was once classified under the nine countries from the WHO African Region for analysis of data from their Medicines Prices Surveys. This Literature based-analysis study made use of articles, journals for assessing and identifying the denominators responsible for high mark-ups on medications. Documentation pharmaceutical policy papers and publications, researches performed using PubMed and WHO/HAI medicine price database were also used to assess those areas and come up with possible strategies to reduce high price of medication and improve access of healthcare by the public. In private sectors, regulating mark-ups is more complex and weaker than in the public sector which is a reason for higher medicine costs. Policy development need to be reviewed in terms of pricing policies and regulation of mark-ups so that people of South Africa receive the medicine they need at a cost that they and the system as a whole can afford.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability. The price disparities and affordability challenges identified underscore the necessity for policy interventions such as price regulation and subsidized programs to ensure equitable access to essential noncommunicable disease medications in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'SAGE Open Medicine', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503121241266318', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292716, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%. Five studies showed that, on average 1.6\\xa0days’ wages of the Lowest-Paid Government Worker (LPGW) was required to purchase generic CV medicines in the public sector. Efficient forecasting and procurement, increased public financing and policies to improve generic use, among others are measures for improving availability and affordability.

Availability, patient prices, and affordability of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was also tracked from 2012 following the rollout of the test and treat policy in 2010. The median patient prices for the artemisinin-based combinations and RDTs was calculated in US dollars (USD). Affordability was assessed by computing the number of days’ wages the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) had to pay to purchase a treatment course for acute malaria. Availability of artemether/lumefantrine (A/L), the first-line ACT medicine, increased from 85 to100% in the private sector facilities during the study period. However, there was low availability of diagnostic tests in private sector facilities ranging between 13% (2012) and 37% (2018). There was a large reduction in patient prices for an adult treatment course of A/L from USD 8.8 in 2007 to USD 1.1 in 2018, while the price of diagnostics remained mostly stagnant at USD 0.5. The affordability of ACT medicines and RDTs was below one day’s wages for LPGW. Availability of ACT medicines in the private sector medicines retail outlets increased to 100% while the availability of diagnostics remained low. Although malaria treatment was affordable, the price of diagnostics remained stagnant and increased the cumulative cost of malaria management. Malaria stakeholders should consolidate the gains made and consider the inclusion of diagnostic kits in the subsidy programme.', 'venue': 'Malaria Journal', 'year': 2021, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-021-03680-8', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s12936-021-03680-8?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03680-8, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In line with the sustainable development goals, World Health Organization (WHO) has outlined a framework that assists the policy makers to improve access to essential medicines for universal health coverage by 2030. However, the availability and affordability of essential medicines remains suboptimal in several low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the availability, pricing and affordability of essential medicines in eastern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design was employed to conduct this study. Public and private health facilities found in Eastern Ethiopia and which fulfilled criteria set forth by WHO/Health Action International (HAI) guideline and essential medicines listed on WHO/HAI guideline and essential medicine list of Ethiopia were included. Accordingly, 60 medicine outlets were selected based on the WHO/HAI standardized sampling methodology. A standardized data collection tools developed by WHO/HAI, with necessary modifications, was employed to collect the data. Median Price Ratio (MPR) was computed as a ratio of median local buyers’ price to international buyers’ reference price. The Mann–Whitney U test was employed to compare the median buyers’ price between public and private health facilities. Kruskal–Wallis test was also run to explore the median price difference among all facilities. Treatment affordability was calculated based on the number of days of wage of the lowest-paid government employee of Ethiopia required to purchase the prescribed regimen. The overall percent availability of originator brand (OB) versions of essential medicines was found to be 3.6% (range: 0.0–31.7%), with the public and private sectors contributing 1.43% and 5.50%, respectively. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics (LPGs) was 46.97% (range: 1.7–93.3%) (Public: 42.5%; private: 50.8%). Only eight LPGs (16.0%) met the WHO target of 80%. The Mann–Whitney U test indicated that 64% drugs showed statistically significant median price difference between public and private settings (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The MPR value indicated that the median buyers’ price of drugs in private sector were more than four times the international reference price in 30% of drugs. The percentage of unaffordable medicine were 72.09 and 91.84% for public and private facilities, respectively, with 79.17% of the medicines were unaffordable when both settings were combined. Only 16% of the surveyed medicines surpassed the WHO cut-off point of 80%. Nearly one-third of drugs in the private sector had a price of more than four times compared to the international reference prices. Moreover, four out of five drugs were found unaffordable when both settings were combined, demanded several days of wage of lowest paid government employee.

This affects access to effective treatment increasing risk of malaria parasite resistance development and adverse drug events. This study investigated access to quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QAACT) medicines among clients of selected private drug-outlets in Uganda. Methods This was a cross sectional study where exit interviews were conducted among clients of private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings in Uganda. This study adapted the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardized criteria. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire. Data entry screen with checks was created in Epi-data ver 4.2 software and data entered in duplicate. Data was transferred to STATA ver 14.0 and cleaned prior to analysis. The analysis was done at 95% level of significance. Results A total of 1114 exit interviews were conducted among systematically sampled drug outlet clients. Over half, 54.9% (611/1114) of the participants were males. Majority, 97.2% (1083/1114) purchased an artemisinin-based combination anti-malarial. Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive. The predictors of accessing a QAACT anti-malarial among drug outlet clients include type of drug outlet visited (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.74; 95%CI 0.6, 0.91), not obtaining full dose (3-day treatment) of ACT (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.49; 95%CI 0.33, 0.73), not finding the ACT expensive (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.03, 1.49), post-primary education (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.29; 95%CI 1.07,1.56), business occupation (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.02,1.50) and not having a prescription (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.76; 95%CI 0.63, 0.92). Conclusion Less than a third of the private drug outlet clients obtained a QAACT for management of malaria symptoms. Individuals who did not find artemisinin-based combinations to be expensive were more likely to obtain a QAACT anti-malarial.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies. Overall, 28.00% of the hospital pharmacies had available CVD medicines during the course of our analysis. The average cost for the 25 CVD medications in hospital pharmacies was $0.699, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.513, which was less than the cost at community pharmacies ($2.741 with an SD of 6.015) (p = 0.045). Conclusion: CVD medications were more available in community pharmacies than in hospital pharmacies, although there were fewer CVD medications available than recommended by the WHO/HAI (80%) in both hospital and community pharmacies.

Regular and adequate supplies of appropriate, safe, and affordable medications are required to provide quality mental health services. However, significant proportions of the population with severe mental disorders are not getting access to treatment. Among others, the availability and affordability of psychotropic medicines are significant barriers for many patients in meeting their medication needs. This study aimed to assess the availability, prices, and affordability of essential psychotropic medicines in the private and public health sectors of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used in 60 retail medicine outlets from the public and private sectors. Stratified random and quota sampling were applied to select the retail outlets. Data was entered and analyzed using the preprogrammed WHO/HAI workbook and SPSS V.25. Results The mean availability of Lower Priced Generic (LPG) psychotropic medicines was 24.33% in Addis Ababa (28.7% in the public sector and 19.80% in the private sector). The Patient prices for the LPG ranged from 0.52–6.43 MPRs in public and 1.08–24.28 MPRs in private sectors.

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer. Notably, tislelizumab emerges as a more accessible alternative to sintilimab and boasts greater affordability compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Consequently, tislelizumab should be considered a viable option for expandable application in first‐line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, contingent upon clinical necessity.', 'venue': 'Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/5599162', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2024/5599162?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/5599162, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Evaluating health systems and various access dimensions availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality is crucial yet rarely performed, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: To evaluate health system capacity and barriers in accessing diagnostics and essential medicines for CVD and diabetes in Nepal. Methods: We conducted a WHO/HAI nationally-representative survey in 45 health-facilities (public-sector: 11; private-sector: 34) in Nepal to collect availability and price data for 21 essential medicines for treating CVD and diabetes, during MayJuly 2017. Data for 13 routine diagnostics was obtained in 12 health facilities. Medicines were considered unaffordable if the lowest paid worker spends >1 days wage to purchase a monthly supply. To evaluate accessibility, we conducted facility exit interviews among 636 CVD patients. Accessibility (e.g., private-public health facility mix, travel to hospital/pharmacy) and acceptability (i.e. Nepals adoption of WHO Essential Medicine List, and patient medication adherence) were summarized using descriptive statistics, and we conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. We did not evaluate medicine quality. Results: We found that mean availability of generic medicines is low (<50%) in both public and private sectors, and less than one-third medicines met WHOs availability target (80%). Mean (SD) availability of diagnostics was 73.1% (26.8%). Essential medicines appear locally unaffordable. On average, the lowest-paid worker would spend 1.03 (public-sector) and 1.26 (private-sector) days wages to purchase a monthly supply. For a person undergoing CVD secondary preventive-interventions in the private sector, the associated expenditure would be 7.511.2% of monthly household income. Exit-interviews suggest that a long/expensive commute to health-facilities and poor medicine affordability constrain access. Conclusions: This study highlights critical gaps in Nepals health system capacity to offer basic health services to CVD and diabetes patients, owing to low availability, poor affordability and accessibility of essential medicines and diagnostics. Research and policy initiatives are needed to ensure uninterrupted supply of affordable essential medicines and diagnostics.', 'venue': 'Global Heart', 'year': 2021, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'http://globalheartjournal.com/articles/10.5334/gh.927/galley/1001/download/', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8139299, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

The inclusion and prices of 26 essential medicines in seven pharmacy discount programs were also studied. The medicine prices were compared with international reference prices (IRPs).ResultsIn surveyed pharmacies, the OB medicines were less available as compared to the generics. The OB and LPG versions of OTC medicines were 21.33 and 11.53 times the IRP, respectively. The median prices of prescription medicines were higher, with OB and LPG versions at 158.14 and 38.03 times the IRP, respectively. In studied pharmacy discount programs, the price ratios of surveyed medicines varied from 4.4–13.9.ConclusionsWhile noting the WHO target that consumers should pay no more than four times the IRPs, medicine prices were considerably higher in the Boston area. The prices for medicines included in the pharmacy discount programs were closest to WHO’s target. Consumers should shop around, as medicine inclusion and prices vary across discount programs.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

People with diabetes using insulin also require self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) devices (e.g., meters, strips, continuous monitoring systems) for day-to-day management. It is essential to ensure that insulin and these devices are available and affordable. This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors. Conversely, better availability was observed in private facilities for SMBG devices as public sector facilities did not supply devices for self-testing. Median prices for 1000IU analogues varied between the public sector (US$ 5.26) and the private sector (US$11.24). The highest median price of analogues was seen in online marketplaces (US$ 28.65). The least costly median price of SMBG devices were observed in online platforms (meter: US$ 18.37, test strip: US$ 0.27, lancet: US$ 0.02). A low-income person had to work 2–3 days to buy 1000IU of analogues. It required 5–7 days’ and 4–5 day’s wages to purchase a meter and a month’s supply of test strips, respectively.

The study aims to compare the prices of medicines used in the management of pain, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in private pharmacies and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Tanzania. Pharmacy prices were also compared with the prices of medicines surveyed nationally by WHO/HAI in 2012. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Dodoma, and Kilimanjaro regions from February to April 2015. Data were collected from 33 private pharmacies, NHIF and, the HAI database. The study used the WHO/HAI methodology. The analysis was done using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc pair-wise comparison Dunn test, while a possible change in prices between our survey and 2012 WHO/HAI national survey data was tested using a Sign test in Stata version 16.1. Results Twenty-eight essential medicines, of which 9 are used for management of pain, 7 for diabetes, and 12 for cardiovascular diseases were analyzed. There was a significant difference in the mean pharmacy prices of some medicines between the regions and between the pharmacies and NHIF reference prices. NHIF reference prices were higher than the pharmacy prices for 16 of the 28 medicines. There was a significant increase in the prices of 5 out of the 8 medicines that were also nationally surveyed by the WHO/HAI in 2012. Conclusion The study found that medicine prices in private pharmacies vary a lot between the study regions, which raises equity concerns. Also, there was a significant difference between the pharmacy and the NHIF reimbursement prices, which may expose patients to fraudulent co-payments or hinder timely access to prescribed medicines. Therefore, effective price control policies and regulations for medicines are warranted in Tanzania.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2020, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12939-020-01319-9', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7653889, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Insulin was discovered a century ago; however, its access in several parts of the globe remains an issue. This study aims to evaluate prices, availability, and affordability (access components) of insulin and five comparator medicine access in Pakistan. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate the access to insulin and some comparator medicines in eight cities of Pakistan, using a modified WHO/HAI methodology. The survey included 80 medicine outlets, i.e., 40 private pharmacies and 40 public hospitals. Data for every unique insulin product available in the Pakistani market were obtained, including five comparator medicines. Percentage availability, median unit prices (MUPs), and affordability (the number of days’ wages (NDWs) required for a month’s course by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker) of all products were calculated, including originator brands (OBs) and biosimilar (BS) products. Results: Of all insulin products surveyed (n = 320), 87.5% were manufactured by foreign multinational companies (MNCs). None of the insulin products had an ideal availability of 80% in any of the surveyed health facilities. In the public sector, none of the insulin products had an availability of more than 50%. In the public sector, the overall availability of human insulin was 70% (including OB and BS). While in the private sector, the overall availability of human insulin was 90% and that of analog insulin was 62.5%. The analog insulin products were 72.8% costlier than the human insulin products. The median prices of BS insulin were 25.4% lower than the OB products, indicating that almost one-fourth of the cost could be saved by switching to BS human insulin from OB human insulin. All oral anti-diabetic medicines were found to be affordable, whereas none of the insulin was affordable. The NDWs for human and analog insulin were 1.38 and 5.06. Conclusion: In Pakistan, the insulin availability falls short of the WHO’s benchmark of 80%. Insulin continues to be unaffordable in both private and government sectors. To increase insulin access, the government should optimize insulin procurement at all levels, promote local production, enforce biosimilar prescribing, and provide financial subsidies for these products.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Pharmacology', 'year': 2022, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.820621/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9010947, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In studied pharmacy discount programs, the price ratios of surveyed medicines varied from 4.4–13.9. While noting the WHO target that consumers should pay no more than four times the IRPs, medicine prices were considerably higher in the Boston area. The prices for medicines included in the pharmacy discount programs were closest to WHO’s target. Consumers should shop around, as medicine inclusion and prices vary across discount programs.

To perform a comparative analysis of cardiovascular medicine prices in 2011 and 2015 and to assess their availability and affordability as a basis for rational pharmacotherapy. Material and methods . We conducted a comparative analysis of prices for cardiovascular medicines in 2011 and 201 5 in Kazan using the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology, to assess medicines' availability and affordability to ensure their rational use. We studied availability and prices of 71 cardiovascular medicines in public and private pharmacies of the city of Kazan and analyzed procurement prices of these medicines in hospitals. Also we performed pharmacoeconomic cost-minimisation analysis for arterial hypertension pharmacotherapy in 2015. For each medicine, we analyzed the prices for the original brand drug and its lowest-priced generic. We compared medicine prices with international reference prices of 201 0 and 201 5, delivered by the Management Sciences for Health, by expressing them as median price ratio. Recording and analysis were performed using the standardized MS Excel WHO/HAI Workbook. Results . The prices of generic medicines, both in the public and private sectors, decreased relative to reference prices in 2015 compared to 2011. In 201 1 one third of the medicines were purchased as original brands and in 201 5 almost all medicines were procured as generics with a fourfold decrease in prices. In 201 5, depending on the choice of the medicine the annual course of monotherapy of hypertension varied from 208 to 281 05 rubles. Conclusion. Over the five years from 2011 to 2015, there was a general trend of price reduction for generic products relative to reference prices for cardiovascular medicines.

Comprehensive data were gathered on medicines in three therapeutic classes to assess the adequacy of WHO/HAI's target medicines list and the focus on only two product versions. WHO/HAI median retail prices were compared with average wholesale prices from global pharmaceutical sales data supplier IMS Health.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nNo significant differences were found in overall availability or prices of target list medicines by retail location. The comprehensive survey of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, anti-diabetic, and anti-ulcer products revealed that some treatments not on the target list were costlier for patients and more likely to be unavailable, particularly in remote areas. WHO/HAI retail prices and IMS wholesale prices were strongly correlated for higher priced products, and weakly correlated for lower priced products (which had higher estimated retailer markups).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe WHO/HAI survey approach strikes an appropriate balance between modest research costs and optimal information for policy.

This study assessed available products, prices and affordability of essential medicines (EM) in community pharmacies in Sri Lanka with comparison of registration status from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority(NMRA). Methods A cross-sectional island-wide survey of 80 pharmacies was conducted according to World Health Organization and Health Action International Manual (WHO/HAI). Hundred medicines were selected from the global core list(n\\u2009=\\u200914), regional core list(n\\u2009=\\u200916) and the Sri Lanka Essential Medicine List (SL-EML) (n\\u2009=\\u200970) based on healthcare needs. Number of registered products in 2015 and 2021 were compared. Findings Average availability was 85.4%(±\\u200912.31) and availability was lowest in the Northern province (69.38\\u2009±\\u200921.18%)(p\\u2009=\\u20090.008). Availability between the state owned, franchise and privately owned pharmacies was not significantly different (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). 89.4% medicines were affordable except for amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, sitagliptin, soluble insulin, isophane insulin, losartan, levodopa carbidopa combination, clonazepam and ceftriaxone. The median price ratio (MPR) of 33.7% of medicines was less than 1 and MPR of 37.1% originator brands (OB) was over 3. Median number of generic brands in the market was 8(range 2–44), 9% of medicines had 20 or more products in the market and 72.7% medicines had more products available than the number registered in 2015. The average number of registered products were similar in 2015 (8.27) and 2021(7.59) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.15). Conclusion The overall availability of EMs in Sri Lanka was high in all categories of community pharmacies. Medicines were largely affordable and reasonably priced in 2015, although OBs were generally more expensive.

Employing modified WHO/HAI methodology, we used mixed-methods analysis to study insulin access and factors influencing insulin supply and demand in Bengaluru in December 2017. We assessed insulin availability, price and affordability in a representative sample of 5 public-sector hospitals, 5 private-sector hospitals and 30 retail pharmacies. We obtained insulin price data from websites of government Jan Aushadhi scheme (JAS) and four online private-sector retail pharmacies. We interviewed wholesalers in April 2018 to understand insulin market dynamics. Mean availability of insulins on India’s 2015 Essential Medicine List was 66.7% in the public sector, lower than private-sector retail (76.1%) and hospital pharmacies (93.3%). Among private retailers, mean availability was higher among chain (96.7%) than independent pharmacies (68.3%). Non-Indian companies supplied 67.3% products in both sectors. 79.1% products were manufactured in India, of which 60% were marketed by non-Indian companies. In private retail pharmacies, median consumer prices of human insulin cartridges and pens were 2.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, that of human insulin vials. Analogues depending on delivery device were twice as expensive as human insulin. Human insulin vials were 18.3% less expensive in JAS pharmacies than private retail pharmacies. The lowest paid unskilled worker would pay 1.4 to 9.3\\u2009days’ wages for a month’s supply, depending on insulin type and health sector. Wholesaler interviews suggest that challenges constraining patient insulin access include limited market competition, physicians' preference for non-Indian insulins, and the ongoing transition from human to analogue insulin. Rising popularity of online and chain pharmacies may influence insulin access. Insulin availability in Bengaluru’s public sector falls short of WHO’s 80% target. Insulin remains unaffordable in both private and public sectors. To improve insulin availability and affordability, government should streamline insulin procurement and supply chains at different levels, mandate biosimilar prescribing, educate physicians to pursue evidence-based prescribing, and empower pharmacists with brand substitution. Patients must be encouraged to shop around for lower prices from subsidized schemes like JAS. While non-Indian companies dominate Bengaluru’s insulin market, rising market competition from Indian companies may improve access.\", 'venue': 'Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice', 'year': 2019, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40545-019-0190-1', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6796433, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This was done by using the standard WHO/Health Action International (HAI) methodology. Methods: The price and availability data for 18 CVD medicines were collected from public sector hospitals (n = 40) and private sector retail pharmacies (n = 40) in eight cities of Pakistan. The outcome measures were availability (calculated as percentage of health facilities stocked with listed medicines), medicine price to the international reference price ratio (i.e., median price ratio (MPR)), and affordability (calculated as number of days’ wages (NDWs) of the lowest paid unskilled government worker required to afford one-month treatment of a chronic disease). The affordability of standard treatment in Pakistan with four CVD drugs was compared with data from six other low and middle income countries (LMICs) using HAI database. Findings: The mean percent availability of CVD medicines was significantly low (p < 0.001) in the public sector as compared to the private sector, that is, 25.5% vs. 54.6% for originator brands (OBs) and 30.4% vs. 34.9% for lowest price generics (LPGs), respectively. For all OBs and LPGs, the inflation-adjusted mean MPR was 2.72 and 1, respectively. CVD medicines were found to be unaffordable with average NDWs of 6.4 and 2.2 for OBs and LPGs, respectively, that is, NDWs of more than 1. In international comparison with countries such as Sudan, Lebanon, Egypt, India, Afghanistan, and China, the affordability of standard treatment with selected CVD medicines (atenolol, amlodipine, captopril, and simvastatin) in Pakistan was found to be low. Overall, all four OBs and three out of four LPGs of selected CVD drugs were found unaffordable in Pakistan. Conclusion: This data indicated that the availability of selected CVD medicines was low in both public and private sector medicine outlets. Both OBs and LPGs were found unaffordable in the private sector, necessitating the redressal of pricing policies, structuring, and their implementation.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Pharmacology', 'year': 2021, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.595008/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7941209, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Use of the most effective treatments remains inadequate for those in need and there is concern over the emergence of resistance. Rapid, accurate and accessible detection of malaria parasites plays a role in promoting more rational use of increasingly costly drugs in many endemic areas. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer the potential to provide accurate diagnosis to all at-risk populations for the first time, reaching those unable to access good quality microscopy services. In 2010, the Global Fund launched the Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria (AMFm) designed to increase access and use of good quality artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for malaria treatment. AMFm involves manufacturer price negotiations, subsidies and other interventions. The aim of this study was to document the availability of ACTs and RDTs provided under the National Malaria Elimination Programme via the AMFm financing strategy. Materials and Methods Investigators were systematically selected and trained on the data collection tool from the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) Workbook. Data was collected from public and private facilities in 12 states in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria in April and May 2014. Returned survey forms were checked, entered and verified. Data analysis was carried out using the embedded analysis toolkit in the WHO/HAI Workbook after double-entry and auto-checking of data. Data was analysed for the public and private sectors. Results Seven AMFm products are available in the country, and include AL (IPCA), Artemef (Cipla), Coartem AMFm (Novartis), Combisunate (Ajanta), Lumartem (Cipla) as well as Arsuamoon (Guilin) and Coarsucam (Sanofi-Winthrop). The results reveal that antimalarials are largely concentrated in the private sector (private pharmacies and PPMVs). About 86% of the surveyed facilities had at least one AMFm AL product whereas only 18% had any AMFm AA product. Results show that the availability of the various AMFm AL products varies across the country. Lumartem by Cipla has the highest national availability with 26.4%, closely followed by AL (IPCA) with 25.7%. Twenty seven (%) of the facilities had an RDT in stock.

Yet, there are barriers to their availability. Tracer medicines (TMs), as a representative subset of Essential Medicines (EMs) was pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a 100% expected availability benchmark. Managing the availability of TMs is a determinant of pharmacy performance, access to medicines and healthcare quality. There is paucity of studies on the availability of TMs in an obstetrics and Gynecology unit of a hospital.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the study was to assess availability of TMs in in an Obstetrics Gynecology (O &G) Department of a Teaching Hospital.\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe study was conducted on the 31st of January each year from 2019 to 2023 at the O & G department of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Data collected were analyzed using a modified WHO/ Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology to review TM availability only. The original WHO/HAI methodology reviews TM prices, availability and affordability. TM is available if physically existent and unexpired on the day of survey.\\n\\nResults\\nAt the O & G, there are 21 molecules that are classified as TM. For the years 2020, 2021 and 2023, all 21 molecules were 100% available on the day of the survey. In 2019 and 2022, 85.7% and 90.5% availability were recorded. Specific TMs that recorded some stock outs were Injections Ephedrine 30mg, Injection Magnesium sulphate 50%, Injection pethidine 100mg, Injection Vitamin K 1mg, as well as Tetracycline eye ointment.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAvailability of TMs for women’s healthcare was less than 100% expected benchmark on some occasions.

The aim of our study was to continue a comparative analysis of availability and access to cardiovascular medicines in 2017 and 2018 in the city of Kazan according to the original WHO/HAI methodology to assess the effectiveness of government interventions to ensure access to medicines.Material and methods. We performed a comparative analysis of prices of cardiovascular medicines in 2017 and 2018 in Kazan using the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology, to assess medicines' availability and affordability to ensure their rational use. We studied availability and prices of 71 cardiovascular medicines in public and private pharmacies in the city of Kazan and analyzed procurement prices of these medicines in hospitals. Also we studied the affordability of medicines, as well as performed pharmacoeconomic cost-minimization analysis for arterial hypertension pharmacotherapy in 2018. For each name, we studied the prices for the original brand and its lowest-priced generic. We compared medicine prices with international reference, delivered by the Management Sciences for Health and by expressing them as median price ratio (MPR).Results. In the public sector, prices of generic medicines were at the level of reference prices with the indicators of MPR 1.14 [0.41-1.84] and 1.17 [0.49-2.21], in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In the private sector, prices of generics reduced 2 times in 2018 compared to 2017, with the decrease in MPR from 2.22 [1.12-3.91] to 1.25 [0.44-2.32], (p<0.05). In the public sector, the affordability indicators of generics were the same in the studied years (Me=0.24 in 2017 and Me=0.26 in 2018). However, in the private sector there was a 2.5 times reduction in the affordability of generics (reduction Me from 0.66 to 0.24, p<0.05) in 2018 compared to 2017. From 2017 to 2018 the affordability of original brands changed from 1.9 to 1.3 in the public sector and from 2.3 to 1.5 in the private sector, but this change was not statistically significant (p>0.05). In 2018, depending on the choice of the medicine the annual course of therapy of hypertension varied from 149 to 28835 rubles.Conclusions. In 2018, the prices of generic cardiovascular medicines, but not of originator brands, reached the level of reference prices in both the public and private sectors of Kazan. According to the WHO/HAI methodology, generic cardiovascular medicines became affordable. In the private sector, there was a reduction in the prices of generic medicines, but not of originator brands, with an improvement of affordability of generics in 2018 compared to 2017.\", 'venue': 'Rational Pharmacotherapy in Cardiology', 'year': 2020, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.rpcardio.com/jour/article/download/2326/2089', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.20996/1819-6446-2020-11-05?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.20996/1819-6446-2020-11-05, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise. With the implementation of negotiation policy, the average number of days of disposable income per capita required for 1\\u202fmonth of medicine costs changed from 104\\u202fdays to 36\\u202fdays and 256\\u202fdays to 80\\u202fdays for urban and rural residents, respectively. The affordable proportion of anticancer medicines is still not high. Conclusion The NDPN policy has reduced the prices of anticancer drugs and greatly improved their affordability. More attention should be paid to improve the affordability to the rural and the poor patients. It is essential to encourage the research and development of high-quality generic drugs to strengthen reasonable market competition, as well as improve the multi-tiered medical security system.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'year': 2025, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1368718', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11747042, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study investigated accessibility, availability and affordability of a basket of priority medicines for children under 5 years in public and private healthcare sector pharmacies in the eThekwini Metropolitan area in Durban, South Africa. The WHO/HAI survey tool for assessing medicine prices, availability and affordability was adapted and employed for a basket of WHO Priority life-saving medicines for children under 5 years. Six district hospitals in the north, south and central eThekwini Metropolitan were selected as major facility reference points and for data collection and pharmacies within a 5 km radius from each major facility were also invited to participate in the study, as outlined in the WHO/HAI tool methodology. Of the 58 pharmacies selected, a total of 27 pharmacies from both private and public healthcare sectors agreed to participate and were surveyed, representing a 47% response rate. Data was analysed using Microsoft excel. All participating pharmacies (and hence the selected basket of priority medicines at these facilities) were deemed accessible. Overall the public sector had more medicines available on the shelf (averaging 64%) than the private sector (48%) which had more medicines available on order (84%). At least one medicine for each of the eight (8) conditions was available at both sectors which meant patients could be treated for these conditions. Medicines for priority conditions (except HIV, which was a 28-day course) were deemed affordable as these regimens were obtainable within a day’s wage for the lowest paid unskilled worker. Priority medicines for children under 5 years were more available and more affordable in the public sector. The basket of WHO essential medicines for priority conditions for children under 5 years were accessible, available and affordable in the eThekwini Metropolitan areas.

The South African government, when faced with high medicine prices, implemented the Single Exit Price (SEP) in 2004. This study assessed the impact of the of the Single Exit Price (SEP) regulation introduced in South Africa in 2004 on a basket of generic. Method Private sector price data of a basket of medicines (December 1999 to December 2014) was obtained from various price files (Pharmacy Software Vendors and Community Pharmacy). The price of the medicine was expressed in a single unit dose. The medicines investigated used the WHO/HAI methodology. The Interrupted Time-Series (ITS) model was used to estimate the change in slope and level of medicines investigated (50 originator and its available generics) before and after the policy change. Results Majority of the medicines analysed reflect a substantial decrease in medicine prices immediately after implementation of the pricing regulations as reflected in both the change in level and the change in slope using the interrupted time series analysis. Discussion This study indicates that the SEP regulation had an impact on medicine pricing in South Africa in both the short (immediately on the introduction) and long term (over the study period). Most medicines investigated showed a smaller yearly increase in price compared to before regulations.

However, despite over 3 decades of international efforts, studies show an inconsistent pattern in the availability of essential medicines. We evaluated and compared the availability of essential medicines, and medicines not included in national EMLs, at global and regional levels. Methods Medicine availability in the public and private sector were calculated based on data obtained from national and provincial facility-based surveys undertaken in 23 countries using the WHO/HAI methodology. The medicines were grouped according to their inclusion (‘essential’) or exclusion (termed ‘non-essential’) in each country’s EML current at the time of the survey. Availability was calculated for originator brands, generics and any product type (originator brands or generics) and compared between the two groups. Results were aggregated by WHO regions, World Bank country income groups, a wealth inequality measure, and therapeutic groups. Findings Across all sectors and any product type, the median availability of essential medicines was suboptimal at 61·5% (IQR 20·6%–86·7%) but significantly higher than non-essential medicines at 27·3% (IQR 3·6%–70·0%).

Results: A set of 30 vital and essential medicines were selected from the list of essential medicines that are used in healthcare centers in Yemen to treat prevalent diseases. In general, only 52.8% of the selected medicines were available in public and private healthcare settings. The distribution and availability of medicines in the three governorates were approximately equal. The availability of medicines was better in the private healthcare settings, specifically 73.3% in private hospitals and approximately 79.7% in private pharmacies.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets, respectively. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively.

Methods A quantitative research was carried out using the methodology developed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). The prices were compared with international reference prices (IRPs) to obtain a median price ratio. The daily wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker was used as the standard of the affordability for the medicines. In this study, ten medicines of the IHD were included. The data were collected from 10 private medicine outlets for both originator brand (OB) and lowest-priced generic brand (LPG) in Bangi, Selangor. Results From the results, the mean availability of OB and LPG were 30% and 42%, respectively. Final patient prices for LPG and OB were about 10.77 and 24.09 times their IRPs, respectively. Medicines that consumes more than a day’s wage are considered unaffordable. Almost half of the IHD medications cost more than one day’s wage. For example, the lowest paid unskilled government worker would need 1.4 days’ wage for captopril, while 1.2 days’ wage to purchase enalapril for LPG. Meanwhile, for OB, the costs rise to 3.4 days’ wage for amlodipine and 3.3 days’ wage for simvastatin.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Nepal in 2015 using World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. We collected data on the availability and price of 60 essential NCD medicines from medicine distribution outlets in both the public and private health care sectors in 6 regions. Essential NCD medicines were more available in the private sector (78%) than the public sector (60%). Furosemide tablets were the cheapest (NPR 0.6/10 tablets) and streptokinase injections were the most expensive (NPR 2200/vial) drugs. There was no significant difference (P > .05) in availability and affordability of essential NCD medicines across the 6 survey areas. Treating selected NCD conditions with medicines was generally affordable, with 1 month of treatment costing no more than a day’s wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors. Medicines are affordable in the public sector but Most medicines are unaffordable in private pharmacies, private clinics and faith-based health facilities.

We studied access to insulin in the private-sector market of Delhi state, India. Methods A modified World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey to assess insulin availability and prices, and qualitative interviews with insulin retailers (pharmacists) and wholesalers to understand insulin market dynamics. Results In 40 pharmacy outlets analysed, mean availability of the human and analogue insulins on the 2013 Delhi essential medicine list was 44.4% and 13.1%, respectively. 82% of pharmacies had domestically manufactured human insulin phials, primarily was made in India under licence to overseas pharmaceutical companies. Analogue insulin was only in cartridge and pen forms that were 4.42 and 5.81 times, respectively, the price of human insulin phials. Domestically manufactured human phial and cartridge insulin (produced for foreign and Indian companies) was less expensive than their imported counterparts. The lowest paid unskilled government worker in Delhi would work about 1.5 and 8.6\\u2005days, respectively, to be able to pay OOP for a monthly supply of human phial and analogue cartridge insulin. Interviews suggest that the Delhi insulin market is dominated by a few multinational companies that import and/or license in-country production. Several factors influence insulin uptake by patients, including doctor's prescribing preference. Wholesalers have negative perceptions about domestic insulin manufacturing. Conclusions The Delhi insulin market is an oligopoly with limited market competition. Increasing competition from Indian companies is going to require some additional policies, not presently in place. As more Indian companies produce biosimilars, brand substitution policies are needed to be able to benefit from market competition.\", 'venue': 'BMJ Global Health', 'year': 2016, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/1/3/e000112.full.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5321364, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5 mg and metformin 500 mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively. Conclusions There are big gaps in availability and affordability of EMs used for diabetes in central Ethiopia. Policy makers should work to improve access to diabetes EMs. It is recommended to increase government attention to availing affordable EMs for diabetes care including at the primary healthcare levels which are more accessible to the majority of the population. Similar studies are also recommended to be conducted in different parts of Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'Global Health Research and Policy', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s41256-024-00352-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10999076, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore division, Pakistan. The survey was undertaken from November, 2016 till March, 2017 by including 50 medicines, 14 from the WHO/HAI core list and 36 supplementary medicines from national essential medicine list (NEML) at public (n = 16) and private (n = 16) health facilities. The prices, availability and affordability of selected medicines were measured using a variant of the WHO/HAI standard methodology available on HAI website and WHO/HAI manual. A questionnaire was used for data collection from Lahore division. The prices were compared to International reference prices (IRPs) and the daily wage of a lowest paid unskilled government worker was used to calculate medicine affordability. Data suggested poor availability of originator brands (OB) in public and private sector facilities, i.e., 6.8% and 55.0%, respectively. Similarly, low availability was observed for lowest price generics (LPGs), both in public (35.3%) and private sector (20.3%) facilities–far below the WHO global action plan targets of 80% availability of essential medicines by 2025. In private sector, 53% OB and 38% LPG medicines were found excessively priced. The cost of standard treatment with OBs was unaffordable, i.e., above a single daily wage (1.4 day’s wages) was demanded to purchase the standard treatment for the selected diseases in case of OBs medicines. Whereas, the cost of LPGs medicine required to purchase the standard treatment of the selected diseases was 0.6 day’s wage (median), below a single daily wage. In conclusion, access to essential medicines, especially at public sector facilities was affected by low availability, particularly of OBs in comparison to LPGs. Thus, the better availability of LPGs might be a rational basis of transition into a generic system of prescribing that may improve the availability and accessibility of essential medicines in Lahore division. Medicine prices in Lahore division were found higher in comparison to IRPs. Thus, the efforts must be made to formulate patient’s pocket friendly drug pricing policy that favors price cuts and improves affordability.', 'venue': 'PLoS ONE', 'year': 2019, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216122', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483245, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to evaluate the current price and affordability of rare disease drugs in China, with evidence from Shandong province. Methods: Data on prices and affordability of 50 drugs for 22 rare diseases were collected from secondary and tertiary public hospitals in Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratios (MPRs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of one month’s treatment. Results: Out of the 50 rare disease drugs, 11 drugs had MSH reference prices and 34 had PBS reference prices. Median prices of 11 drugs were higher than MSH reference prices (median 1.33), and median prices of 34 drugs were higher that Australian PBS prices (median 1.97).

Data on procurement price and availability was collected from three public healthcare providers in the state: the federal (central) government, state government and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Overall a total of 83 public facilities, 68 primary care, 10 secondary cares and 5 tertiary care facilities were surveyed. Data was also collected from private retail (n\\u2009=\\u200940) and chain pharmacies (n\\u2009=\\u200940) of a leading corporate house. Prices were compared to an international reference price (expressed as median price ratio-MPR). Public sector: Delhi state government has its essential medicine list (Delhi state EML) and was using Delhi state EML 2007 for procurement; the other two agencies had their own procurement list. All the antibiotics procured including second and third generation antibiotics except for injections were available at primary care facilities. Antibiotic available were on the basis of supply rather than rationality or the Delhi state EML and none was 100% available. There was sub-optimal availability of some essential antibiotics while other non-essential ones were freely available. Availability of antibiotics at tertiary care facilities was also sub-optimal. Private sector: Availability of antibiotics was good. For most of the antibiotics the most expensive and popular trade names were often available.

This emphasis is now being challenged by renewed policy interest in the potential benefits of local pharmaceutical production and supply. However, there is a shortage of evidence on the role of locally produced medicines in African markets, and on potential benefits of local production for access to medicines. This article contributes to filling that gap.MethodsThis article uses WHO/HAI data from Tanzania for 2006 and 2009 on prices and sources of a set of tracer essential medicines. It employs innovative graphical methods of analysis alongside conventional statistical testing.ResultsMedicines produced in Tanzania were equally likely to be found in rural and in urban areas. Imported medicines, especially those imported from countries other than Kenya (mainly from India) displayed 'urban bias’: that is, they were significantly more likely to be available in urban than in rural areas. This finding holds across the range of sample medicines studied, and cannot be explained by price differences alone. While different private distribution networks for essential medicines may provide part of the explanation, this cannot explain why the urban bias in availability of imported medicines is also found in the public sector.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that enhanced local production may improve rural access to medicines. The potential benefits of local production and scope for their improvement are an important field for further research, and indicate a key policy area in which economic development and health care objectives may reinforce each other.\", 'venue': 'Globalization and Health', 'year': 2014, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1744-8603-10-12', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4021829, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nonavailability of child size medicines encourages the use of adult dosage forms, splitting them into parts before giving to a child. This practice is not scientific and is far from rational, since children are not just miniature adults. Thus many children lack access to essential treatment because no suitable formulation exists, or those that do are either not available or are too expensive. In the backdrop of paucity of literature addressing this problem in India, this preliminary cross-sectional survey was planned to assess the availability and pricing of some common pediatric medicines in government health facilities vis-à-vis in private retail pharmacies. The study was conducted during May-June, 2011 in the district of East Godabari in Andhra Pradesh, India. The data collection form used for this purpose was developed with little modification of the ‘WHO Children’s Medicines Survey Form’,[2] customizing to suit our purpose. The availability and pricing of 20 core children’s medicines were assessed in the survey. All of these 20 core medicines were in ‘WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children, Oct 2007’,[3] and 15 of them were included in National Essential Medicine List of India 2003. [4] For data collection in this survey the WHO/HAI methodology was followed after due modification.[5] As no patient data were used in this survey, there was no ethical dilemma. However, permission was obtained from local health authority (from Chief Medical Officer of Health of the district) before conducting the survey. Two of the authors (LR and MB) acted as the data collectors, and visited the 8 public health facilities of different tiers, and 7 retail pharmacies, nearest to the respective public health facilities, during a period of 6 weeks in May-June, 2011. In retail pharmacies, the actual price to the patient of the cheapest brand as available on the day of the survey was documented. In public health facilities, procurement prices for medicines were obtained from State government’s Central Drug Stores (CDS) listing. For all practical purposes, formulations that existed in alternative pediatric dosage form and pack size were regarded as ‘available’. Overall, the availability was at best sub-optimal in all levels of public health facilities 35% in the teaching hospital pharmacy, 30% in the district hospital, 35% in primary health centers (PHCs) and 30% in community health centers (CHCs). Even availability in retail pharmacies was only 37.85% [Table 1]. Out of the 20 formulations, only six amoxicillin oral suspension, amoxicillin-clavulanate oral suspension, injection ceftiaxone, cotrimoxazole oral suspension, ORS sachet, paracetamol syrup were available in all the public facilities surveyed, as compared to only 5, e.g., amoxicillin oral suspension, injection ceftiaxone, ferrous salt suspension (combined with folic acid), ORS sachet, paracetamol syrup, in all private pharmacies. As high as 13 formulations (acyclovir suspension, artemether-lumefantrine tablet, beclomethasone inhaler, carbamazepine suspension, INH tablet, mebendazole chewable tablet, mebendazole syrup, nevirapine syrup, nystatin drops, rifampin-isoniazid tablet, salbutamol inhaler, vitamin A capsule, zinc dispersible tablet) i.e., 65% of the basket of medicines, were not available in any of the eight public facilities surveyed, while 10 out of the 20 core medicines, e.g., acyclovir suspension, artemetherlumefantrin tablet, beclomethasone inhaler, carbamazepine suspension, INH tablet, nevirapine syrup, nystatin drops, rifampin-isoniazid tablet, vitamin A capsule, zinc dispersible tablet, i.e., 50% were not available in any private pharmacy. The last named 10 medicines were not available in any government facilities either. Availability of anti-infectives was also poor in general. As many as 7 out of 12 (58.33%) antiinfective formulations in the WHO list of 20 core medicines were not available in either government hospitals or in retail pharmacies [Table 1]. The price comparison of medicines was done only for those items that were available in all or most of the government and private facilities. The cost of even the cheapest brand for a given medicine as available in a retail pharmacy was much higher than the procurement price of the same item for government facilities. Barring for one item, amoxicillin suspension, the variation of prices of medicines among different private facilities was not too wide. For amoxicillin suspension, the price range of the cheapest available products in different retail pharmacies was to the tune of Rs 80 – Rs 28 [Table 2].

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi. This may affect the quality of care among pediatric patients and therefore contribute to morbidity and mortality in Malawi. The supply of medicines and health commodities needs to consider needs of special populations such as children to achieve universal health coverage.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Pharmacology', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1379250/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043549, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price. There is need for awareness creation, surveillance, and monitoring of the implementation of Copayment mechanism in the country.', 'venue': 'PLoS ONE', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295198&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10971760, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper aims to evaluate the availability, prices and affordability of essential medicines in Jiangsu Province, China after the implementation of the policy in 2009.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Jiangsu in 2013 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Data on the availability and prices of 50 essential medicines were collected from the public and private healthcare sectors.ResultsThe mean availabilities of innovator brands and lowest priced generics (LPGs) were 11.5\\xa0% and 100\\xa0% in primary healthcare facilities, 36.8\\xa0% and 32.6\\xa0% in the secondary and tertiary sectors, and 18.7\\xa0% and 42.9\\xa0% in the private sector, respectively. The median price ratios (MPRs) were 1.26 to 2.05 for generics and 3.76 to 27.22 for innovator brands. Treating ten common diseases with LPGs was generally affordable, whereas treatment with IBs was less affordable.ConclusionsThe high availability of LPGs at primary healthcare facilities reflects the success of the essential medicine policy, while the low availability in secondary and tertiary levels and in private pharmacies reflects a failure to implement the policy in these levels.

Design The assessment was undertaken using data from Health Action International (HAI) research on sexual and reproductive health commodities based on a cross-sectional design adapted from the standardised WHO/HAI methodology. Setting Data were collected from 376 health facilities in in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia in July and August 2017. Outcome measures Availability was calculated as mean percentage of sampled medicine outlets where medicine was found on the day of data collection. Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices (IRP) and expressed as median price ratios. Affordability was calculated using number of days required to pay for a standard treatment based on the daily income of the lowest paid government worker. Results Availability of either oxytocin or misoprostol at health facilities was high; 81% in Kenya, 82% in Uganda and 76% in Zambia. Oxytocin was more available than misoprostol, and it was most available in the public sector in the three countries. Availability of misoprostol was highest in the public sector in Uganda (88%). Oxytocin and misoprostol were purchased by patients at prices above IRP, but both medicines cost less than a day’s wages and were therefore affordable. Availability of misoprostol was poor in rural settings where it would be more preferred due to lack of trained personnel and cold storage facilities required for oxytocin. Conclusion Availability and affordability of either oxytocin or misoprostol at health facilities met the WHO benchmark of 80%. However, countries with limited resources should explore mechanisms to optimise management of PPH by improving access to misoprostol especially in rural areas.', 'venue': 'BMJ Open', 'year': 2021, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/11/1/e042948.full.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7797249, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Correspondence: Salman Mehmood (salman_731a@hotmail.com) Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice 2020, 13(Suppl 1):01 Pharmaceutical industry is one of the main contributors of public health. In a pharmaceutical industry, Data integrity is one of the most important aspect that relates to drug quality, safety, efficacy and purity. Recently, many industries have been given warning letters due to the violation of data integrity and strict action had been taken by international and local regulatory authorities. Data integrity should be a part of pharmaceutical policy. It claims that product has been manufactured after meeting the predetermined specification and quality attributes and showed compliance of testing methods according to the guidelines given in official books. The FDA, USA considers integrity of data, from initial step where it is generated, and extending throughout its life cycle, to be a critical component which ensures that only high quality and safe drugs are manufactured. Hence, it is essential to record each and every detail of drug manufacturing and testing which should comply with cGMP practices. In future, the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data will decide the fate of the pharmaceutical companies. 02 Essential Medicines Prices in Russian Public Health Facilities in 2010 and 2015 Chinara Maratovna Razzakova, Liliya Eugenevna Ziganshina Research & Education Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Cochrane Russia, Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russian Federation Correspondence: Chinara Maratovna Razzakova (razzakova345@gmail.com) Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice 2020, 13(Suppl 1):02 Effective medicine procurement is key to improve rational use of financial resources, and to improve Universal Health Coverage. Over the last decades drug prices in Russia have been rising. In 2013 the Government decree on the rules for medicinal products procurement came into force as a high level intervention to reduce medicine prices. Health Action International (HAI), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), has developed methodology to measure medicine price comparisons, medicine availability and affordability, changes over time and crosscountry comparisons [1]. The objective of our study was to assess effects of governmental interventions aimed at drug price reductions by comparing medicine prices in public hospitals in Russia in 2010 and 2015.We used WHO/HAI methodology to collect and process collected data [1]. We obtained procurement prices from state owned pharmacies of public hospitals of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russian Federation (medicines for © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This artic International License (http://creativecommons reproduction in any medium, provided you g the Creative Commons license, and indicate if (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/ze hospitals). We surveyed 95 medicines totally: 30 medicines from the WHO/HAI recommended list (14 global list and 16 regional list) and 65 cardiovascular medicines (supplementary list). For each medicine, we collected prices for the lowest priced generic (LPG) and the original brand (OB). We calculated median price ratios (MPR) for each listed product. The MPR was the ratio of the local median unit price of a given medicine to the median unit price of the international reference prices (IRP) obtained from the Management Sciences for Health Price Indicator Guide for the years 2010 and 2015 [2]. MPR value of 1 or less indicates that the collected prices are within acceptable range and not excessive. Not all medicines selected for the study were purchased by the surveyed public hospitals. We collected data on state procurement of 61 medicines in 2010 and 29 medicines in 2015.In 2010, 48 medicines were procured as LPGs (11 – global list, 12 – regional list and 25 – supplementary list) and 13 – as OBs (2 – global list, 2 – regional list and 9 – supplementary list). The prices of medicines exceeded the IRP by 3 to 12 times, with the MPR for LPGs being 2.9 [1,8–5,5] and for OBs – 12,3 [4,4–14,9]. In 2015 public hospitals procured 28 medicines as generic versions and only 1 medicine as an originator brand (amiodarone 50 mg/ml). These 28 LPGs consisted of 6 medicines from the global list, 3 medicines – regional list and 19 – supplementary list. This was due to the 2013 Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation, which restricted procurement of originator brands, by means of creating a special list of medicines allowed for procurement as originator brands [3]. In 2015, the MPR for LPGs was 1.1 [0.2–2.6] and for OB – 2.0. We see the marked decrease of state procurement medicine prices in 2015 compared to 2010, by at least 2 times for LPMs, and 6 times for OBs. Interventions at the highest governmental level, aimed at lowering medicine prices, proved successful in terms of the reduction of public procurement of originator brands (OBs) and preferential procurement of lowest priced generics (LPGs), and the overall reduction of procurement prices by at least 2 times for lowest priced generics (LPGs) and 6 times for OBs. These governmental interventions resulted in a more effective medicine procurement in 2015 compared to 2010. 03 Post marketing Surveillance and costs of leading brands Of ciprofloxacin tablets marketed in urban Areas Of Mongolia Azjargal Ganbat, 2 Tsetsegmaa Sanjjav 1,3 Bruce Sunderland, Gantuya Dorj Gereltuya Dorj School of Pharmacy, Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences, S.

The information is useful for product improvement, development of standards and regulations. The study aimed to examine in vitro quality control tests and estimate the cost of five brands of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride 500 mg tablets available in Mongolia. The quality control parameters of five different brands of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride 500 mg tablets were tested and evaluated against British Pharmacopoeia (BP) and Mongolian National Pharmacopoeia (MNP). The cost of five leading brands of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet was obtained from the selected retailers and wholesalers by using a WHO standardized methodology. A Median Price Ratio (MPR) was calculated in order to compare the wholesaling and retail costs of ciprofloxacin tablets with their counterparts reported by the Management Sciences for Health (MSH). All brands were in compliance in terms of weight variation (0.8%-3.4%) and friability (0.6-1.5). Assay content indicated that all samples were within approved limits [Brand C -98.4%, Brand B -100.3%, Brand D -99.1%, Brand A-101.5%, Brand C-102.8%]. However, disintegration and dissolution tests were non-compliant for Brand B and C. The mean cost of ciprofloxacin tablets was 0.12 US$ (0.05-0.33US$) at wholesaler and 0.13 US$ (0.070.24US$) at the retail level. When compared with international price, an MPR of 1.4 for wholesale and MPR of 2.6 for retail level was obtained. The costs of Brand B and C were twice at the wholesale level and up to 5 times higher than in other countries. Only 60% of sampled products met the BP and MNP requirements. More significantly, low quality ciprofloxacin tablets were more expensive than those at the international market. Regular post marketing studies would assure the quality and safety of ciprofloxacin, as well control the cost of ciprofloxacin in Mongolia. 04 Analysis of Drug Availability and Inventory Control in Health Centers,Province Yogyakarta, Indonesia Satibi Satibi, M.

Access to medicines is recognized as an important determinant of treatment adherence. The access to glaucoma medicines and how it affects glaucoma management are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the availability, affordability, and accessibility of topical intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering eye drops in Haryana state of northern India using the World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done to collect data on prices and availability of glaucoma topical medications in public and private sector pharmacies and retail outlets using the WHO/HAI methodology between October 2021 and January 2022. The availability and affordability of topical glaucoma medicines was determined. Comparison of the local price with international prices was done by calculating the median price ratio (MPR). Results: A total of 191 facilities were randomly sampled across 11 (n = 55) urban, 29 (n = 92) semi-urban, and 44 (n = 44) rural places during the study period. The availability of topical medication for glaucoma was low (35.7 ± 22.3) across all sampled sites and all classes of topical glaucoma medications. The median price of topical medication and availability were negatively correlated, Pearson’s coefficient r (18) = -0.44, P 0.05, though the relationship was weak. A lowest paid, unskilled Indian government worker must spend between 15% and 203% of their daily wage to acquire a glaucoma medication. Conclusion: The availability and accessibility of topical glaucoma medications was low in this survey.', 'venue': 'Indian Journal of Ophthalmology', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2186_23', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCSA', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11338402, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Patient price and availability were collected from capital cities of 6 states as per WHO/HAI methodology. Data were collected and analyzed for 50 medicines from the 104 medicines restricted to local manufacturer. Availability was based on whether the medicine was in stock on the day of data collection at the surveyed facility. Prices were expressed as median price ratio (MPR).\\n\\nResults\\nAvailability of locally manufactured medicines (LMM) was much better than imported medicines (IM), in the public, (47.2% vs. 14%, respectively) and private (63.9% vs. 23.5%, respectively) sectors. Based on median price ratio (MPR), public sector patient prices for locally manufactured medicines were lowered priced and had a median MPR of 2.4 (n=42) than imported medicines which had a median MPR of 4.99 (n=20). In private sector patient prices for locally manufactured medicines were also lowered priced and had a median MPR of 2.76 (n=45) than imported medicines which had a median MPR of 5.53 (n=27). Thus; patients were paying about 52% less for locally produced than for imported medicines in both sectors\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe survey showed low availability of the basket of medicines surveyed in the public and private sectors for imported medicines (I.M), while not achieving WHO’s target of 80 % for locally manufactured medicines (LMM). In developing countries a lot of barriers are well known to business and industrial need to be resolved in order to maintain availability and self-reliance in drug production as a mean of increasing access to medicines.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2020, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'http://openaccesspub.org/article/1237/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14302/issn.2641-5526.jmid-19-3119?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14302/issn.2641-5526.jmid-19-3119, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, one third of the world’s population lacks regular access to essential medicines. The purpose of this study was to assess the availability, price, and affordability of medicines for mental disorders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was done in selected pharmacies after modification of a WHO/HAI methodology developed questionnaire. Data on the availability and price of 28 lowest priced generics and originator brand essential psychotropic medicines were collected from seven public sectors, five private sectors, and seven other sectors (five Kenema Public Community Pharmacies and two Red Cross Pharmacies) in Addis Ababa between May 9 and May 31, 2022. The data were analyzed using the developed WHO/HAI workbook part I Excel sheet. Descriptive results were reported in text and table format. Results The overall availability of lowest-priced generics medication was 41.69%. The availability of lowest-priced generics and originator brand medication was 54.68% and 1.7% in the public pharmacies; 24.14% and 0.0% in private pharmacies; 43% and 0.0% in Red Cross Pharmacies; and 42% and 3.2% in Kenema Public Community Pharmacies. The median price ratio in the public, private, Red Cross, and Kenema Public Community pharmacies was 1.26, 3.72, 1.65, and 1.59, respectively. Most of the medications were unaffordable. A patient could be required to pay up to 73 days wages to purchase a standard treatment for 1 month. Conclusion The availability of psychotropic medicines was lower than the WHO target for non-communicable diseases and most of the available medicines were unaffordable.', 'venue': 'Risk Management and Healthcare Policy', 'year': 2023, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=89874', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10216867, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Baseline data needed to develop effective public health policy and provide equitable access to essential medicines. The present survey was conducted to investigate the price, availability, and affordability of fifty essential medicines in the public and private sector in Delhi, India using standardized WHO/HAI methodology.MethodsData on procurement price and availability was collected (July-October 2011) from three public healthcare providers: the federal (central) government, state government and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Data on price and availability of medicines was collected from private retail and chain pharmacies of a leading corporate house. Prices were compared to an international reference price (expressed as median price ratio-MPR).ResultsThe procurement price of surveyed medicines was 0.53-0.82 times the international reference price-IRP. However, the overall mean availability of surveyed medicines in facilities under state government and MCD was 41.3% and 23.2%, respectively. The overall mean availability of medicines in three tertiary care facilities operated by the federal government was 49.3%. Availability of generic medicines was much higher in the private sector. Off-patented medicines, like diazepam, diclofenac, and doxycycline had the highest MPRs. The price ratio between procurement and retail was as high as 28 (range 11–28) for certain medicines. Seven-day treatment with a popular brand of amoxicillin+clavulanic acid or one inhaler each of budesonide and salbutamol cost 2.3 and 1.4 days’ wages for the lowest paid government worker. A majority of India’s population cannot afford these prices.ConclusionsThis study revealed that procurement prices of surveyed medicines were reasonable in comparison to IRP. However, variation in procurement prices of certain medicines by different public procurement agencies was noted. Availability of medicines was very poor in public sector facilities, which are the primary source of free medicines for a majority of India’s low-income population. Availability of medicines is better in private retail pharmacies but affordability remains a big challenge for a majority of the population. These data have significant policy implications that could help in amending policies to increase the access to essential medicines for India’s population.', 'venue': 'BMC Health Services Research', 'year': 2013, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1472-6963-13-285', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3733775, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study aims to explore the government interventions on medicine pricing in Thailand. Methods: Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research included a literature review and a cross-sectional survey of medicine prices using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Data were collected from both public and private sectors across six provinces in Thailand during April–May 2023. Additionally, international price comparisons were conducted with countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Results: The research identified a significant reduction in the median price ratios (MPRs) of medicines, closer alignment of prices with international benchmarks, and decreased variability in pricing between regions and sectors. These changes illustrated the positive effects of Thailand’s pricing policies implemented over the past 16 years. Conclusions: The strategic interventions implemented by the Thai government have markedly enhanced the regulation and affordability of medicine prices. However, to sustain these achievements and ensure the viability of the local pharmaceutical industry, ongoing efforts and policy adaptations are essential. This study emphasises the critical need for continuous evaluation of these policies to respond effectively to evolving healthcare and economic conditions.', 'venue': 'Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice', 'year': 2025, 'isOpenAccess': False, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852222, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Using a modified WHO/HAI medicinal price methodology, we examined the availability, median price ratios (MPRs), mean percentage difference, and affordability of the standard treatment of the originator brand (OB) and lowest-priced generic (LPG) OPAIMs in 30 private and 2 state-owned pharmacies. The study revealed disparities in availability, with only 50% of private pharmacies offering all 11 medicinal drugs in their generic form. The MPRs of OPAIMs for OB and LPG varied, with three drugs exceeding the financially acceptable MPR of 2 (albendazole, amoxicillin, and erythromycin). The standard treatment with LPGs costs between 0.17 and 0.85 and between 0.06 and 0.28 days’ wages for the lowest daily salary of the private sector and unskilled public employees, respectively. We identified erythromycin and albendazole as having less than 50% availability in their generic form in private pharmacies. To address these findings, we recommend frequent pricing revisions based on exchange rates and associated costs, coupled with the establishment of a transparent scientific criterion to subsidize essential medicines deemed “unaffordable.” Failure to implement such measures amidst economic crises may adversely impact financial access to essential medications.', 'venue': 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2813-0618/3/1/11/pdf?version=1710252941', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/pharma3010011?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/pharma3010011, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability. The price disparities and affordability challenges identified underscore the necessity for policy interventions such as price regulation and subsidized programs to ensure equitable access to essential noncommunicable disease medications in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'SAGE Open Medicine', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503121241266318', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292716, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%. Five studies showed that, on average 1.6\\xa0days’ wages of the Lowest-Paid Government Worker (LPGW) was required to purchase generic CV medicines in the public sector. Efficient forecasting and procurement, increased public financing and policies to improve generic use, among others are measures for improving availability and affordability.

However, nearly one-third of the global population have no access to it. This magnitude is even much worse in low- and middle-income countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 12 to June 5, 2024 to determine availability, price and affordability of essential medicines for managing cardiovascular diseases using WHO/HAI methodology in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on the availability and price of the lowest priced generic medicines were collected from five public, ten private and eight other sectors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The availability was assessed as the percentage of health facilities that stocked the listed medicines. The prices of these medicines were evaluated across all sectors. Price variations were calculated to identify differences among these settings. Additionally, medicine prices were compared against the management sciences for health (MSH) International Reference Prices to calculate the Median Price Ratio (MPR), providing a standardized measure of price affordability and accessibility.

This affects access to effective treatment increasing risk of malaria parasite resistance development and adverse drug events. This study investigated access to quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QAACT) medicines among clients of selected private drug-outlets in Uganda. Methods This was a cross sectional study where exit interviews were conducted among clients of private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings in Uganda. This study adapted the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardized criteria. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire. Data entry screen with checks was created in Epi-data ver 4.2 software and data entered in duplicate. Data was transferred to STATA ver 14.0 and cleaned prior to analysis. The analysis was done at 95% level of significance. Results A total of 1114 exit interviews were conducted among systematically sampled drug outlet clients. Over half, 54.9% (611/1114) of the participants were males. Majority, 97.2% (1083/1114) purchased an artemisinin-based combination anti-malarial. Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive. The predictors of accessing a QAACT anti-malarial among drug outlet clients include type of drug outlet visited (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.74; 95%CI 0.6, 0.91), not obtaining full dose (3-day treatment) of ACT (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.49; 95%CI 0.33, 0.73), not finding the ACT expensive (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.03, 1.49), post-primary education (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.29; 95%CI 1.07,1.56), business occupation (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.02,1.50) and not having a prescription (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.76; 95%CI 0.63, 0.92).

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies.

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected.

Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets, respectively. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively.

WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors. Medicines are affordable in the public sector but Most medicines are unaffordable in private pharmacies, private clinics and faith-based health facilities. Poor medicines availability in the public sector contributes to the overall unaffordability of medicines in all the other sectors.', 'venue': 'Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice', 'year': 2023, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40545-023-00675-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10757353, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the accessibility of EMs used for diabetes care in central Ethiopia’s public and private medicine outlets with respect to availability and affordability parameters. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5 mg and metformin 500 mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively. Conclusions There are big gaps in availability and affordability of EMs used for diabetes in central Ethiopia. Policy makers should work to improve access to diabetes EMs. It is recommended to increase government attention to availing affordable EMs for diabetes care including at the primary healthcare levels which are more accessible to the majority of the population.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

This study aims to explore the government interventions on medicine pricing in Thailand. Methods: Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research included a literature review and a cross-sectional survey of medicine prices using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Data were collected from both public and private sectors across six provinces in Thailand during April–May 2023. Additionally, international price comparisons were conducted with countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Results: The research identified a significant reduction in the median price ratios (MPRs) of medicines, closer alignment of prices with international benchmarks, and decreased variability in pricing between regions and sectors. These changes illustrated the positive effects of Thailand’s pricing policies implemented over the past 16 years. Conclusions: The strategic interventions implemented by the Thai government have markedly enhanced the regulation and affordability of medicine prices. However, to sustain these achievements and ensure the viability of the local pharmaceutical industry, ongoing efforts and policy adaptations are essential.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%.

However, nearly one-third of the global population have no access to it. This magnitude is even much worse in low- and middle-income countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 12 to June 5, 2024 to determine availability, price and affordability of essential medicines for managing cardiovascular diseases using WHO/HAI methodology in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on the availability and price of the lowest priced generic medicines were collected from five public, ten private and eight other sectors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The availability was assessed as the percentage of health facilities that stocked the listed medicines. The prices of these medicines were evaluated across all sectors. Price variations were calculated to identify differences among these settings. Additionally, medicine prices were compared against the management sciences for health (MSH) International Reference Prices to calculate the Median Price Ratio (MPR), providing a standardized measure of price affordability and accessibility. The data was analyzed using WHO/HAI work book Excel sheet V 15. The overall availability of generic drugs in all sectors was found to be 34.52%. The availability was 33.73, 40.58, 29.8 and 33.99% in Public, Private, Kenema and Red Cross pharmacies, respectively.

This affects access to effective treatment increasing risk of malaria parasite resistance development and adverse drug events. This study investigated access to quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QAACT) medicines among clients of selected private drug-outlets in Uganda. Methods This was a cross sectional study where exit interviews were conducted among clients of private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings in Uganda. This study adapted the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardized criteria. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire. Data entry screen with checks was created in Epi-data ver 4.2 software and data entered in duplicate. Data was transferred to STATA ver 14.0 and cleaned prior to analysis. The analysis was done at 95% level of significance. Results A total of 1114 exit interviews were conducted among systematically sampled drug outlet clients. Over half, 54.9% (611/1114) of the participants were males. Majority, 97.2% (1083/1114) purchased an artemisinin-based combination anti-malarial. Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies.

Regular and adequate supplies of appropriate, safe, and affordable medications are required to provide quality mental health services. However, significant proportions of the population with severe mental disorders are not getting access to treatment. Among others, the availability and affordability of psychotropic medicines are significant barriers for many patients in meeting their medication needs. This study aimed to assess the availability, prices, and affordability of essential psychotropic medicines in the private and public health sectors of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used in 60 retail medicine outlets from the public and private sectors. Stratified random and quota sampling were applied to select the retail outlets. Data was entered and analyzed using the preprogrammed WHO/HAI workbook and SPSS V.25. Results The mean availability of Lower Priced Generic (LPG) psychotropic medicines was 24.33% in Addis Ababa (28.7% in the public sector and 19.80% in the private sector).

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer. Notably, tislelizumab emerges as a more accessible alternative to sintilimab and boasts greater affordability compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors. Conversely, better availability was observed in private facilities for SMBG devices as public sector facilities did not supply devices for self-testing. Median prices for 1000IU analogues varied between the public sector (US$ 5.26) and the private sector (US$11.24). The highest median price of analogues was seen in online marketplaces (US$ 28.65).

This study assessed available products, prices and affordability of essential medicines (EM) in community pharmacies in Sri Lanka with comparison of registration status from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority(NMRA). Methods A cross-sectional island-wide survey of 80 pharmacies was conducted according to World Health Organization and Health Action International Manual (WHO/HAI). Hundred medicines were selected from the global core list(n\\u2009=\\u200914), regional core list(n\\u2009=\\u200916) and the Sri Lanka Essential Medicine List (SL-EML) (n\\u2009=\\u200970) based on healthcare needs. Number of registered products in 2015 and 2021 were compared. Findings Average availability was 85.4%(±\\u200912.31) and availability was lowest in the Northern province (69.38\\u2009±\\u200921.18%)(p\\u2009=\\u20090.008). Availability between the state owned, franchise and privately owned pharmacies was not significantly different (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). 89.4% medicines were affordable except for amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, sitagliptin, soluble insulin, isophane insulin, losartan, levodopa carbidopa combination, clonazepam and ceftriaxone. The median price ratio (MPR) of 33.7% of medicines was less than 1 and MPR of 37.1% originator brands (OB) was over 3. Median number of generic brands in the market was 8(range 2–44), 9% of medicines had 20 or more products in the market and 72.7% medicines had more products available than the number registered in 2015. The average number of registered products were similar in 2015 (8.27) and 2021(7.59) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.15). Conclusion The overall availability of EMs in Sri Lanka was high in all categories of community pharmacies.

Yet, there are barriers to their availability. Tracer medicines (TMs), as a representative subset of Essential Medicines (EMs) was pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a 100% expected availability benchmark. Managing the availability of TMs is a determinant of pharmacy performance, access to medicines and healthcare quality. There is paucity of studies on the availability of TMs in an obstetrics and Gynecology unit of a hospital.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the study was to assess availability of TMs in in an Obstetrics Gynecology (O &G) Department of a Teaching Hospital.\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe study was conducted on the 31st of January each year from 2019 to 2023 at the O & G department of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Data collected were analyzed using a modified WHO/ Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology to review TM availability only. The original WHO/HAI methodology reviews TM prices, availability and affordability. TM is available if physically existent and unexpired on the day of survey.\\n\\nResults\\nAt the O & G, there are 21 molecules that are classified as TM. For the years 2020, 2021 and 2023, all 21 molecules were 100% available on the day of the survey. In 2019 and 2022, 85.7% and 90.5% availability were recorded. Specific TMs that recorded some stock outs were Injections Ephedrine 30mg, Injection Magnesium sulphate 50%, Injection pethidine 100mg, Injection Vitamin K 1mg, as well as Tetracycline eye ointment.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAvailability of TMs for women’s healthcare was less than 100% expected benchmark on some occasions.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise. With the implementation of negotiation policy, the average number of days of disposable income per capita required for 1\\u202fmonth of medicine costs changed from 104\\u202fdays to 36\\u202fdays and 256\\u202fdays to 80\\u202fdays for urban and rural residents, respectively. The affordable proportion of anticancer medicines is still not high. Conclusion The NDPN policy has reduced the prices of anticancer drugs and greatly improved their affordability. More attention should be paid to improve the affordability to the rural and the poor patients.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets, respectively. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors.

Methods Using the standard survey method jointly developed by the WHO and Health Action International (HAI), a sample of 50 essential drugs was selected to investigate and evaluate their availability and affordability in public medical and health institutions and social retail pharmacies in Wuhan, using six diseases with high clinical morbidity as the targets. Results The availability of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug in public hospitals is 26.4 and 42.47% respectively, and that in retail pharmacies is 26.8 and 54.4% respectively. The median price ratio of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug is 28.71 and 2.23 respectively in public hospitals, and 29.24 and 3.59 respectively in retail pharmacies; In addition to individual drugs, such as omeprazole, others are affordable. The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. Conclusion The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. The price of the original drug is much higher than the international reference price; The price of medicines in public hospitals is lower than that in retail pharmacies;the overall condition of affordability is good, but there is a big gap between the affordability levels of original drugs and generic drugs, and the affordability of original drugs is relatively poor. It is recommended to adjust the relevant policies according to the actual situation of Wuhan city itself, moderately ensure the supply of original drugs, improve the price transparency of retail pharmacies, and ensure that the basic drug needs of the public are met.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'year': 2023, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1108007/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9911549, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi. This may affect the quality of care among pediatric patients and therefore contribute to morbidity and mortality in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

The study revealed disparities in availability, with only 50% of private pharmacies offering all 11 medicinal drugs in their generic form. The MPRs of OPAIMs for OB and LPG varied, with three drugs exceeding the financially acceptable MPR of 2 (albendazole, amoxicillin, and erythromycin). The standard treatment with LPGs costs between 0.17 and 0.85 and between 0.06 and 0.28 days’ wages for the lowest daily salary of the private sector and unskilled public employees, respectively.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability. The price disparities and affordability challenges identified underscore the necessity for policy interventions such as price regulation and subsidized programs to ensure equitable access to essential noncommunicable disease medications in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'SAGE Open Medicine', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503121241266318', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292716, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%. Five studies showed that, on average 1.6\\xa0days’ wages of the Lowest-Paid Government Worker (LPGW) was required to purchase generic CV medicines in the public sector. Efficient forecasting and procurement, increased public financing and policies to improve generic use, among others are measures for improving availability and affordability.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies.

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer. Notably, tislelizumab emerges as a more accessible alternative to sintilimab and boasts greater affordability compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Consequently, tislelizumab should be considered a viable option for expandable application in first‐line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, contingent upon clinical necessity.', 'venue': 'Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/5599162', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2024/5599162?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/5599162, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors.

This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets, respectively. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors. Medicines are affordable in the public sector but Most medicines are unaffordable in private pharmacies, private clinics and faith-based health facilities. Poor medicines availability in the public sector contributes to the overall unaffordability of medicines in all the other sectors.', 'venue': 'Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice', 'year': 2023, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40545-023-00675-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10757353, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the accessibility of EMs used for diabetes care in central Ethiopia’s public and private medicine outlets with respect to availability and affordability parameters. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5 mg and metformin 500 mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability. The median price based on the least measurable unit of LPG diabetes EMs was 1.6 ETB (0.033 USD) in public and 4.65 ETB (0.095 USD) in private outlets. The cost of one month’s supply of diabetes EMs was equivalent to 0.3 to 3.1 days wages in public and 1.0 to 11.0 days wages in private outlets, respectively, for a typical LPGW. Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively. Conclusions There are big gaps in availability and affordability of EMs used for diabetes in central Ethiopia. Policy makers should work to improve access to diabetes EMs. It is recommended to increase government attention to availing affordable EMs for diabetes care including at the primary healthcare levels which are more accessible to the majority of the population.

Methods Using the standard survey method jointly developed by the WHO and Health Action International (HAI), a sample of 50 essential drugs was selected to investigate and evaluate their availability and affordability in public medical and health institutions and social retail pharmacies in Wuhan, using six diseases with high clinical morbidity as the targets. Results The availability of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug in public hospitals is 26.4 and 42.47% respectively, and that in retail pharmacies is 26.8 and 54.4% respectively. The median price ratio of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug is 28.71 and 2.23 respectively in public hospitals, and 29.24 and 3.59 respectively in retail pharmacies; In addition to individual drugs, such as omeprazole, others are affordable. The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. Conclusion The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. The price of the original drug is much higher than the international reference price; The price of medicines in public hospitals is lower than that in retail pharmacies;the overall condition of affordability is good, but there is a big gap between the affordability levels of original drugs and generic drugs, and the affordability of original drugs is relatively poor.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability. The price disparities and affordability challenges identified underscore the necessity for policy interventions such as price regulation and subsidized programs to ensure equitable access to essential noncommunicable disease medications in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'SAGE Open Medicine', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503121241266318', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292716, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%.

Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive. The predictors of accessing a QAACT anti-malarial among drug outlet clients include type of drug outlet visited (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.74; 95%CI 0.6, 0.91), not obtaining full dose (3-day treatment) of ACT (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.49; 95%CI 0.33, 0.73), not finding the ACT expensive (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.03, 1.49), post-primary education (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.29; 95%CI 1.07,1.56), business occupation (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.02,1.50) and not having a prescription (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.76; 95%CI 0.63, 0.92). Conclusion Less than a third of the private drug outlet clients obtained a QAACT for management of malaria symptoms. Individuals who did not find artemisinin-based combinations to be expensive were more likely to obtain a QAACT anti-malarial. The Ministry of Health needs to conduct regular surveillance to monitor accessibility of QAACT anti-malarial agents under the current private sector copayment mechanism.', 'venue': 'Malaria Journal', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies. Overall, 28.00% of the hospital pharmacies had available CVD medicines during the course of our analysis. The average cost for the 25 CVD medications in hospital pharmacies was $0.699, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.513, which was less than the cost at community pharmacies ($2.741 with an SD of 6.015) (p = 0.045). Conclusion: CVD medications were more available in community pharmacies than in hospital pharmacies, although there were fewer CVD medications available than recommended by the WHO/HAI (80%) in both hospital and community pharmacies.

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors. Conversely, better availability was observed in private facilities for SMBG devices as public sector facilities did not supply devices for self-testing.

This study assessed available products, prices and affordability of essential medicines (EM) in community pharmacies in Sri Lanka with comparison of registration status from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority(NMRA). Methods A cross-sectional island-wide survey of 80 pharmacies was conducted according to World Health Organization and Health Action International Manual (WHO/HAI). Hundred medicines were selected from the global core list(n\\u2009=\\u200914), regional core list(n\\u2009=\\u200916) and the Sri Lanka Essential Medicine List (SL-EML) (n\\u2009=\\u200970) based on healthcare needs. Number of registered products in 2015 and 2021 were compared. Findings Average availability was 85.4%(±\\u200912.31) and availability was lowest in the Northern province (69.38\\u2009±\\u200921.18%)(p\\u2009=\\u20090.008). Availability between the state owned, franchise and privately owned pharmacies was not significantly different (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). 89.4% medicines were affordable except for amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, sitagliptin, soluble insulin, isophane insulin, losartan, levodopa carbidopa combination, clonazepam and ceftriaxone. The median price ratio (MPR) of 33.7% of medicines was less than 1 and MPR of 37.1% originator brands (OB) was over 3. Median number of generic brands in the market was 8(range 2–44), 9% of medicines had 20 or more products in the market and 72.7% medicines had more products available than the number registered in 2015. The average number of registered products were similar in 2015 (8.27) and 2021(7.59) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.15).

Yet, there are barriers to their availability. Tracer medicines (TMs), as a representative subset of Essential Medicines (EMs) was pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a 100% expected availability benchmark. Managing the availability of TMs is a determinant of pharmacy performance, access to medicines and healthcare quality. There is paucity of studies on the availability of TMs in an obstetrics and Gynecology unit of a hospital.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the study was to assess availability of TMs in in an Obstetrics Gynecology (O &G) Department of a Teaching Hospital.\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe study was conducted on the 31st of January each year from 2019 to 2023 at the O & G department of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Data collected were analyzed using a modified WHO/ Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology to review TM availability only. The original WHO/HAI methodology reviews TM prices, availability and affordability. TM is available if physically existent and unexpired on the day of survey.\\n\\nResults\\nAt the O & G, there are 21 molecules that are classified as TM. For the years 2020, 2021 and 2023, all 21 molecules were 100% available on the day of the survey. In 2019 and 2022, 85.7% and 90.5% availability were recorded. Specific TMs that recorded some stock outs were Injections Ephedrine 30mg, Injection Magnesium sulphate 50%, Injection pethidine 100mg, Injection Vitamin K 1mg, as well as Tetracycline eye ointment.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAvailability of TMs for women’s healthcare was less than 100% expected benchmark on some occasions.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise. With the implementation of negotiation policy, the average number of days of disposable income per capita required for 1\\u202fmonth of medicine costs changed from 104\\u202fdays to 36\\u202fdays and 256\\u202fdays to 80\\u202fdays for urban and rural residents, respectively. The affordable proportion of anticancer medicines is still not high. Conclusion The NDPN policy has reduced the prices of anticancer drugs and greatly improved their affordability. More attention should be paid to improve the affordability to the rural and the poor patients.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors. Medicines are affordable in the public sector but Most medicines are unaffordable in private pharmacies, private clinics and faith-based health facilities.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi. This may affect the quality of care among pediatric patients and therefore contribute to morbidity and mortality in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

Using a modified WHO/HAI medicinal price methodology, we examined the availability, median price ratios (MPRs), mean percentage difference, and affordability of the standard treatment of the originator brand (OB) and lowest-priced generic (LPG) OPAIMs in 30 private and 2 state-owned pharmacies. The study revealed disparities in availability, with only 50% of private pharmacies offering all 11 medicinal drugs in their generic form. The MPRs of OPAIMs for OB and LPG varied, with three drugs exceeding the financially acceptable MPR of 2 (albendazole, amoxicillin, and erythromycin). The standard treatment with LPGs costs between 0.17 and 0.85 and between 0.06 and 0.28 days’ wages for the lowest daily salary of the private sector and unskilled public employees, respectively. We identified erythromycin and albendazole as having less than 50% availability in their generic form in private pharmacies.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability.

People with diabetes using insulin also require self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) devices (e.g., meters, strips, continuous monitoring systems) for day-to-day management. It is essential to ensure that insulin and these devices are available and affordable. This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors. Conversely, better availability was observed in private facilities for SMBG devices as public sector facilities did not supply devices for self-testing. Median prices for 1000IU analogues varied between the public sector (US$ 5.26) and the private sector (US$11.24). The highest median price of analogues was seen in online marketplaces (US$ 28.65). The least costly median price of SMBG devices were observed in online platforms (meter: US$ 18.37, test strip: US$ 0.27, lancet: US$ 0.02). A low-income person had to work 2–3 days to buy 1000IU of analogues. It required 5–7 days’ and 4–5 day’s wages to purchase a meter and a month’s supply of test strips, respectively.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability.

While previous studies evaluated overall affordability, few have examined affordability differences across regions and disease types. Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%. Five studies showed that, on average 1.6\\xa0days’ wages of the Lowest-Paid Government Worker (LPGW) was required to purchase generic CV medicines in the public sector. Efficient forecasting and procurement, increased public financing and policies to improve generic use, among others are measures for improving availability and affordability.

Methods This was a cross sectional study where exit interviews were conducted among clients of private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings in Uganda. This study adapted the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardized criteria. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire. Data entry screen with checks was created in Epi-data ver 4.2 software and data entered in duplicate. Data was transferred to STATA ver 14.0 and cleaned prior to analysis. The analysis was done at 95% level of significance. Results A total of 1114 exit interviews were conducted among systematically sampled drug outlet clients. Over half, 54.9% (611/1114) of the participants were males. Majority, 97.2% (1083/1114) purchased an artemisinin-based combination anti-malarial. Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive. The predictors of accessing a QAACT anti-malarial among drug outlet clients include type of drug outlet visited (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.74; 95%CI 0.6, 0.91), not obtaining full dose (3-day treatment) of ACT (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.49; 95%CI 0.33, 0.73), not finding the ACT expensive (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.03, 1.49), post-primary education (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.29; 95%CI 1.07,1.56), business occupation (aPR\\u2009=\\u20091.24; 95%CI 1.02,1.50) and not having a prescription (aPR\\u2009=\\u20090.76; 95%CI 0.63, 0.92). Conclusion Less than a third of the private drug outlet clients obtained a QAACT for management of malaria symptoms. Individuals who did not find artemisinin-based combinations to be expensive were more likely to obtain a QAACT anti-malarial. The Ministry of Health needs to conduct regular surveillance to monitor accessibility of QAACT anti-malarial agents under the current private sector copayment mechanism.', 'venue': 'Malaria Journal', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-024-04956-5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies. Overall, 28.00% of the hospital pharmacies had available CVD medicines during the course of our analysis. The average cost for the 25 CVD medications in hospital pharmacies was $0.699, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.513, which was less than the cost at community pharmacies ($2.741 with an SD of 6.015) (p = 0.045). Conclusion: CVD medications were more available in community pharmacies than in hospital pharmacies, although there were fewer CVD medications available than recommended by the WHO/HAI (80%) in both hospital and community pharmacies.

Regular and adequate supplies of appropriate, safe, and affordable medications are required to provide quality mental health services. However, significant proportions of the population with severe mental disorders are not getting access to treatment. Among others, the availability and affordability of psychotropic medicines are significant barriers for many patients in meeting their medication needs. This study aimed to assess the availability, prices, and affordability of essential psychotropic medicines in the private and public health sectors of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used in 60 retail medicine outlets from the public and private sectors. Stratified random and quota sampling were applied to select the retail outlets. Data was entered and analyzed using the preprogrammed WHO/HAI workbook and SPSS V.25. Results The mean availability of Lower Priced Generic (LPG) psychotropic medicines was 24.33% in Addis Ababa (28.7% in the public sector and 19.80% in the private sector). The Patient prices for the LPG ranged from 0.52–6.43 MPRs in public and 1.08–24.28 MPRs in private sectors.

However, a streamlined and expedited evaluation method for certain tumor types without approved indications is currently lacking in terms of their expandable applications. In this study, a novel evaluation method for the expandability of PD‐1 mAb was established for the first time. Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method. Combining the results of effectiveness, safety, and accessibility, the recommendation for expandability of PD‐1 mAb was provided. Tislelizumab ranks seventh in effectiveness, higher than the chemotherapy group and the pembrolizumab group, and ranks fourth in safety evaluation and first in the combination chemotherapy groups. The annual drug cost of tislelizumab is 0.497 times the annual household income for urban residents of Shaanxi Province. 56.67% of medical institutions are equipped with tislelizumab in Shaanxi Province. These results indicate the promising efficacy and safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first‐line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer. Notably, tislelizumab emerges as a more accessible alternative to sintilimab and boasts greater affordability compared to nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

This study assessed available products, prices and affordability of essential medicines (EM) in community pharmacies in Sri Lanka with comparison of registration status from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority(NMRA). Methods A cross-sectional island-wide survey of 80 pharmacies was conducted according to World Health Organization and Health Action International Manual (WHO/HAI). Hundred medicines were selected from the global core list(n\\u2009=\\u200914), regional core list(n\\u2009=\\u200916) and the Sri Lanka Essential Medicine List (SL-EML) (n\\u2009=\\u200970) based on healthcare needs. Number of registered products in 2015 and 2021 were compared. Findings Average availability was 85.4%(±\\u200912.31) and availability was lowest in the Northern province (69.38\\u2009±\\u200921.18%)(p\\u2009=\\u20090.008). Availability between the state owned, franchise and privately owned pharmacies was not significantly different (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). 89.4% medicines were affordable except for amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, sitagliptin, soluble insulin, isophane insulin, losartan, levodopa carbidopa combination, clonazepam and ceftriaxone. The median price ratio (MPR) of 33.7% of medicines was less than 1 and MPR of 37.1% originator brands (OB) was over 3. Median number of generic brands in the market was 8(range 2–44), 9% of medicines had 20 or more products in the market and 72.7% medicines had more products available than the number registered in 2015. The average number of registered products were similar in 2015 (8.27) and 2021(7.59) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.15).

Yet, there are barriers to their availability. Tracer medicines (TMs), as a representative subset of Essential Medicines (EMs) was pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a 100% expected availability benchmark. Managing the availability of TMs is a determinant of pharmacy performance, access to medicines and healthcare quality. There is paucity of studies on the availability of TMs in an obstetrics and Gynecology unit of a hospital.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the study was to assess availability of TMs in in an Obstetrics Gynecology (O &G) Department of a Teaching Hospital.\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe study was conducted on the 31st of January each year from 2019 to 2023 at the O & G department of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Data collected were analyzed using a modified WHO/ Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology to review TM availability only. The original WHO/HAI methodology reviews TM prices, availability and affordability. TM is available if physically existent and unexpired on the day of survey.\\n\\nResults\\nAt the O & G, there are 21 molecules that are classified as TM. For the years 2020, 2021 and 2023, all 21 molecules were 100% available on the day of the survey. In 2019 and 2022, 85.7% and 90.5% availability were recorded. Specific TMs that recorded some stock outs were Injections Ephedrine 30mg, Injection Magnesium sulphate 50%, Injection pethidine 100mg, Injection Vitamin K 1mg, as well as Tetracycline eye ointment.\\n\\nConclusion\\nAvailability of TMs for women’s healthcare was less than 100% expected benchmark on some occasions.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise. With the implementation of negotiation policy, the average number of days of disposable income per capita required for 1\\u202fmonth of medicine costs changed from 104\\u202fdays to 36\\u202fdays and 256\\u202fdays to 80\\u202fdays for urban and rural residents, respectively. The affordable proportion of anticancer medicines is still not high. Conclusion The NDPN policy has reduced the prices of anticancer drugs and greatly improved their affordability. More attention should be paid to improve the affordability to the rural and the poor patients.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors. Most of the surveyed medicines were unaffordable. The medicines needed to treat non-communicable diseases cost up to 33.7-day wages for one full course of treatment. Conclusions In South Sudan, medicines are poorly available in all sectors. Medicines are affordable in the public sector but Most medicines are unaffordable in private pharmacies, private clinics and faith-based health facilities.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi. This may affect the quality of care among pediatric patients and therefore contribute to morbidity and mortality in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

People with diabetes using insulin also require self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) devices (e.g., meters, strips, continuous monitoring systems) for day-to-day management. It is essential to ensure that insulin and these devices are available and affordable. This study aimed to evaluate the availability, price, and affordability of insulin and SMBG devices in Indonesia using an adaptation of the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) price survey. A total of 34 public health facilities (hospitals, primary healthcare centres/Puskesmas) and 37 private pharmacies were sampled. Information from three major online marketplaces was also collected. Prices were expressed as median patient prices (US$). Affordability was defined as the number of days’ wages needed by the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase 30 days’ supply of insulin, delivery devices and SMBGs. Availability of analogue insulin was slightly higher in public facilities (63.6%) than in the private sector (43.2%), with no human insulin available in both sectors. Conversely, better availability was observed in private facilities for SMBG devices as public sector facilities did not supply devices for self-testing. Median prices for 1000IU analogues varied between the public sector (US$ 5.26) and the private sector (US$11.24). The highest median price of analogues was seen in online marketplaces (US$ 28.65). The least costly median price of SMBG devices were observed in online platforms (meter: US$ 18.37, test strip: US$ 0.27, lancet: US$ 0.02). A low-income person had to work 2–3 days to buy 1000IU of analogues. It required 5–7 days’ and 4–5 day’s wages to purchase a meter and a month’s supply of test strips, respectively.

The study of drug availability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents one of the priority tasks in the organization of effective counteraction to COPD in the Russian Federation.Objective: to assess drug prices, affordability, and availability for COPD patients.Material and methods. The analysis of drug availability for COPD patients was carried out according to the methodology of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy of originator brands and lowest-priced generics was evaluated. The consumption volume of the studied drugs was also analyzed using the ATC/DDD (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification / defined daily dose) pharmacoepidemiologic methodology over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022), taking into account their share of total DDD (drug utilization analysis, DU90%).Results. According to the results of DU90% analysis, the most purchased drugs for bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy for all the years under study were drugs from the groups of short-acting bronchodilators (salbutamol, fenoterol, ipratropium bromide + fenoterol) and inhaled glucocorticoids (budesonide, beclomethasone). The obtained data were confirmed by the results of the physical availability study. Thus, the highest percentage of physical availability was for short-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (SABA) (salbutamol). Analysis of drug affordability also revealed a tendential superiority of SABA and short-acting anticholinergics over baseline bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs.Conclusion. Low affordability of the main drugs of baseline therapy contributes to the burden of COPD and necessitates improvement of drug supply mechanisms for individuals, especially those with low material income, which in the long term will significantly reduce the costs of the healthcare system for the treatment of these patients by decreasing the severity and frequency of exacerbations.', 'venue': 'FARMAKOEKONOMIKA.

Objectives This study focuses on assessing the affordability of medications used for chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) in Iran, specifically on the category R medicines listed in the 2017 Iran drug list (IDL) that are used for the treatment of these diseases, based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) drug code. Methods The affordability of medicines in mono and combination therapy approaches was assessed in CRDs using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology. Accordingly, if out-of-pocket payment for 30-days of pharmacotherapy exceeds one day for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW), it’s considered non-affordable. Results Based on the monotherapy approach, our finding demonstrates that all generic medicines of category R were affordable. However, branded drugs such as Symbicort®, Pulmicort Respules®, Flusalmex®, Seretide®, Fluticort Plus®, Seroflo®, and Salmeflo® cost between 1.2 and 2.5 days’ wage of LPGW and considered unaffordable despite 70% insurance coverage. Moreover, based on the affordability ratio in the combination therapy approach, all medicines used in asthma, COPD, and CF patients with mild respiratory problems are affordable except omalizumab (inj), which is non-affordable due to its high price and no insurance coverage.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out using the World Health Organization/health action international methodology between 2 March and 2 May 2023, within public and private healthcare facilities located in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. The median price ratio served as a metric. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were utilized to assess the normal distribution of price data. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was also employed to compare median buyer’s prices (patient prices) between public and private healthcare institutions. Treatment affordability was determined by estimating the number of days’ wages required by the lowest-paid government employee in Ethiopia to afford the prescribed medication regimen. Results: Among 23 health facilities surveyed, the pooled availability of essential medicine used in the management of noncommunicable diseases was 18.7% (range: 0%–30.1%), with the public and private facilities contributing 16.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The overall percentage of availability originator brand versions was 1.1% for overall health sectors, 0.6% for public sectors, and 1.2% for private sectors. The overall percent availability of lowest price generics was 36.2% (range: 0%–26.2%; public: 32.0%; private: 37.1%). Only seven lowest price generics satisfied the World Health Organization target of 80% and above. The overall median price of lowest price generic medicines in private was two times higher than in public sectors. The top five median price scorers were amlodipine, furosemide, insulin, beclomethasone, and salbutamol. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that 11.6% of lowest price generics medicines had a statistically significant median price disparity between the public and private sectors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The overall percent of unaffordability was found to be 100.0%, (public: 70.4; private: 100.0%). Conclusions: This study revealed the limited availability and potential financial burdens on patients seeking essential noncommunicable disease medications. Limited availability suggests the need for better supply chain management and consistent stock availability.

Given the vastness of China and varying medical policies across cities, this study assesses the affordability of rare diseases based on China’s First List of Rare Diseases (CFLRD), National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and outpatient chronic and special disease policies in each prefecture. Method Six rare diseases were selected and the average annual treatment cost of all relevant drugs in NRDL was calculated for each disease. Based on the WHO/HAI standardized approach, the study analyzed 289 cities with outpatient chronic and special disease policies, measured the security levels by the actual reimbursement ratio of Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) and affordability by the ratio of individual expenses after reimbursement to the annual disposable income of urban residents in the province. The security levels and affordability differences across disease types and provinces were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the K-W test. Result The affordability of rare diseases varied significantly on the disease types and annual treatment cost. Diseases with an annual treatment cost below 100 000 yuan are affordable to all prefectures even with low reimbursement rates, while those with a higher treatment cost were not affordable in at least 80% of prefectures even though the reimbursement ratio is high. The affordability of the same disease varies significantly across provinces and municipalities. Outpatient chronic and special diseases insurance and critical illness insurance, and the inconsistencies between them, result in regional differences. Conclusion Although China has made progress in improving the affordability of rare diseases, significant differences persist between cities and diseases. The study suggests the optimization of the BMI system and explores independent funds and innovative insurance models to enhance the affordability of rare diseases, particularly those with extremely high treatment costs.', 'venue': 'International Journal for Equity in Health', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-024-02137-z', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10953120, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with their limited resources, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may have challenges with access to cardiovascular medicines. The aim of this review was to provide a summary of available evidence on access to cardiovascular medicines in LMICs. Methods We searched PubMed and Google scholar for English language articles on access to cardiovascular medicines for the period 2010–2022. We also searched for articles reporting measures for challenges in access to CV medicines from 2007 to 2022. Studies conducted in LMICs, and reporting availability and affordability were included for review. We also reviewed studies reporting affordability or availability using the World Health Organisation/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) method. Levels of affordability and availability were compared. Results Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for review on availability and affordability. Although availability appears to have improved, many countries did not meet the availability target of 80%. Between economies and within countries, there are equity gaps in access to CV medicines. Availability is lower in public health facilities than private facilities. Seven out of 11 studies reported availability less than 80%. Eight studies which investigated availability in the public sector reported less than 80% availability. Overall, CV medicines, especially combined treatments are not affordable in the majority of countries. Simultaneous achievement of availability and affordability target is low. In the studies reviewed, less than 1–53.5\\xa0days wages were required to purchase one month supply of CV medicines. Failure to meet affordability was 9–75%. Five studies showed that, on average 1.6\\xa0days’ wages of the Lowest-Paid Government Worker (LPGW) was required to purchase generic CV medicines in the public sector. Efficient forecasting and procurement, increased public financing and policies to improve generic use, among others are measures for improving availability and affordability.

This affects access to effective treatment increasing risk of malaria parasite resistance development and adverse drug events. This study investigated access to quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QAACT) medicines among clients of selected private drug-outlets in Uganda. Methods This was a cross sectional study where exit interviews were conducted among clients of private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings in Uganda. This study adapted the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardized criteria. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire. Data entry screen with checks was created in Epi-data ver 4.2 software and data entered in duplicate. Data was transferred to STATA ver 14.0 and cleaned prior to analysis. The analysis was done at 95% level of significance. Results A total of 1114 exit interviews were conducted among systematically sampled drug outlet clients. Over half, 54.9% (611/1114) of the participants were males. Majority, 97.2% (1083/1114) purchased an artemisinin-based combination anti-malarial. Most, 55.5% (618/1114) of the participants had a laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Majority, 77.9% (868/1114) of the participants obtained anti-malarial agents without a prescription. Less than a third, 27.7% (309/1114) of the participants obtained a QAACT. Of the participants who obtained QAACT, more than half 56.9% (173/309) reported finding the medicine expensive.

The availability and price range of cardiovascular medications are significantly limited in both hospital and community pharmacies. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the availability and price variations of commonly used cardiovascular medicines in hospital pharmacies in Gondar Town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: From July 13 to August 6, 2022, a mixed cross-sectional and simulated client survey was carried out at two hospital and 13 community pharmacies in Gondar Town. The analysis and data entry were performed using SPSS Version 25 and EpiData Version 4.2, respectively. The availability and pricing variations of the medications are given as percentages. The significance was examined using paired t tests. Results: On average, community retail pharmacies offered 33.22% of CVD drugs. Aspirin (81\\u2009mg), amlodipine (5\\u2009mg), atorvastatin (20\\u2009mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (25\\u2009mg) were the most readily available drugs in community pharmacies.

Clinical trial data of PD‐1 mAb in first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer were collected for comparison. For the first time, the clinical trial outcomes were analyzed through the entropy weight method and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. The accessibility was assessed using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard survey method.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the WHO/HAI criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings.

However, access to essential medicines remains inadequate in many low-income countries. This study evaluated medications’ availability, price, and affordability for these conditions. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at health facilities in the South Wollo zone in 2022. Following World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) guidelines, 34 medicines were evaluated across 60 medicine outlets. Data were collected using a standardized tool adapted from WHO/HAI. Availability was measured by the percentage of facilities where the medicines were in stock. Prices were reported as median prices and median price ratios (MPR). Affordability was assessed based on the number of days’ wages required for the lowest-paid government workers to cover the full course of therapy. Results The availability of lowest-priced generic (LPG) diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines in the public sector was 24.4% and 28.7%, respectively. In private pharmacies, availability was 26.3% for diabetes and 21% for thyroid dysfunction medicines. Median prices for LPG medicines were higher in private pharmacies than in public health facilities, with 81.81% showing a statistically significant difference (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In private pharmacies, the prices of LPG diabetes (5, 71.43%) and thyroid dysfunction medicines (5, 83.33%) exceeded the reference price. None of the LPG diabetes and thyroid dysfunction medicines were affordable in either setting. Conclusions The study revealed a very low availability of medicines and a financial burden on patients. Therefore, the government should improve the availability of these essential medicines and regulate their prices.

Yet, there are barriers to their availability. Tracer medicines (TMs), as a representative subset of Essential Medicines (EMs) was pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a 100% expected availability benchmark. Managing the availability of TMs is a determinant of pharmacy performance, access to medicines and healthcare quality. There is paucity of studies on the availability of TMs in an obstetrics and Gynecology unit of a hospital.\\n\\nAim\\nThe aim of the study was to assess availability of TMs in in an Obstetrics Gynecology (O &G) Department of a Teaching Hospital.\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe study was conducted on the 31st of January each year from 2019 to 2023 at the O & G department of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Data collected were analyzed using a modified WHO/ Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology to review TM availability only. The original WHO/HAI methodology reviews TM prices, availability and affordability. TM is available if physically existent and unexpired on the day of survey.\\n\\nResults\\nAt the O & G, there are 21 molecules that are classified as TM. For the years 2020, 2021 and 2023, all 21 molecules were 100% available on the day of the survey. In 2019 and 2022, 85.7% and 90.5% availability were recorded.

Anticancer drug is the largest category of NDPN and the number continue to increase. This study evaluated the impact of this policy on the price, utilization rate and affordability of anticancer drugs based on the experiences of Shandong province. Methods 25 anticancer drugs were included in this study involved the NDPN in the year 2018 and 2019. Data on prices and utilization of the policy related drugs from 2017 to 2022 were collected from Shandong Province, using an adaptation of the WHO/HAI methodology. Prices were measured as Median Price Ratio (MPR). Usage was measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs). Affordability was measured as days of daily per capita disposable income required for the cost of 1\\u202fmonth’s treatment. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to estimate the significance of the difference in the change in the MPRs before and after the negotiation. Results The data of this study come from 42 key monitoring medical institutions in Shandong Province, including 31 tertiary medical institutions and 11 secondary medical institutions. There has been a significant reduction in the MPR following NDPN, with a median MPR of 0.57 in 2022, and the prices of anticancer medicines were generally lower than IPR. During the period from 2017 to 2022, the total usage of the 25 negotiated medicines continued to rise.

Effective diabetes management is highly dependent on the availability of affordable and quality-assured essential medicines (EMs) which is a challenge especially in low-and-middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 selected public and private medicine outlets in central Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standard tool to assess access to EMs. We included EMs that lower glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as these are all critical for diabetes care. Availability was determined as the percentage of surveyed outlets per sector in which the selected lowest-priced generic (LPG) and originator brand (OB) products were found. The number of days’ wages required by the lowest paid government worker (LPGW) to purchase a one month’s supply of medicines was used to measure affordability while median price was determined to assess patient price and price markup difference between public procurement and retail prices. Results Across all facilities, availability of LPG and OB medicines were 34.6% and 2.5% respectively. Only two glucose-lowering (glibenclamide 5mg, metformin 500mg) and two blood pressure-lowering medications (nifedipine 20mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) surpassed the WHO’s target of 80% availability.

Access to medicines is a fundamental human right. If medicines are accessible and affordable, they save lives by reducing mortality and morbidity associated with acute and chronic diseases. WHO recommends that all countries voluntarily reach the minimum target of 80% availability of medicines by 2025. The primary purpose of this research is to assess access to essential medicines in Juba County, South Sudan. Methods This study was undertaken using the standard World Health Organization/Health Action International Organization (WHO/HAI) approach for surveying the prices, availability, and affordability of medicines. A survey was conducted in six payams of Juba County, South Sudan, and 55 health facilities were assessed. Results Prices for generic medicines were better in faith-based health facilities with a median price ratio of 1.95. Private pharmacies and private clinics had MPRs of 4.64 and 4.32, respectively. Local prices were high compared to International referent prices. Availability of medicines was highest in the faith-based health facilities (65.5%) and slightly lower in private pharmacies (55.4%), private clinics (57.7%) and public (50.4%) sectors.

Thus, 58.8% and 84.6% of LPG diabetes EMs included in the price analysis were unaffordable in private and public outlets, respectively. Conclusions There are big gaps in availability and affordability of EMs used for diabetes in central Ethiopia. Policy makers should work to improve access to diabetes EMs. It is recommended to increase government attention to availing affordable EMs for diabetes care including at the primary healthcare levels which are more accessible to the majority of the population. Similar studies are also recommended to be conducted in different parts of Ethiopia.', 'venue': 'Global Health Research and Policy', 'year': 2024, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s41256-024-00352-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10999076, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods Using the standard survey method jointly developed by the WHO and Health Action International (HAI), a sample of 50 essential drugs was selected to investigate and evaluate their availability and affordability in public medical and health institutions and social retail pharmacies in Wuhan, using six diseases with high clinical morbidity as the targets. Results The availability of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug in public hospitals is 26.4 and 42.47% respectively, and that in retail pharmacies is 26.8 and 54.4% respectively. The median price ratio of the original drug and the lowest-priced generic drug is 28.71 and 2.23 respectively in public hospitals, and 29.24 and 3.59 respectively in retail pharmacies; In addition to individual drugs, such as omeprazole, others are affordable. The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. Conclusion The availability of essential drugs in public hospitals in Wuhan is lower than that in social retail pharmacies, and the availability of the lowest-priced generic drugs is much higher than that of original drugs. The price of the original drug is much higher than the international reference price; The price of medicines in public hospitals is lower than that in retail pharmacies;the overall condition of affordability is good, but there is a big gap between the affordability levels of original drugs and generic drugs, and the affordability of original drugs is relatively poor. It is recommended to adjust the relevant policies according to the actual situation of Wuhan city itself, moderately ensure the supply of original drugs, improve the price transparency of retail pharmacies, and ensure that the basic drug needs of the public are met.', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'year': 2023, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1108007/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9911549, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We assessed the availability, pricing, and affordability of pediatric formulations in Malawi. Methodology: The study was conducted in 76 health facilities (public, faith-based and private pharmacies, and clinics) from the northern and southern regions of Malawi from March to May 2023. We adapted the WHO/HAI method for the assessment of both availability and pricing of medicines. Data on availability were collected from stock card records using a WHO/HAI template and medicine prices were provided by the pharmacy personnel who were managing the facilities. Availability of medicines was calculated as the percentage of facilities which had a stock of the respective medicine at the time of data collection while medicine prices was assessed by calculating the median prices of each medicine. To assess the affordability of the medicines, we calculated the number of days it takes for a person who is receiving the government-set minimum wage to work to pay for a treatment course of common indications. The study was approved by the KUHES ethics committee under the numbers U.12/22/3900 and U.12/22/3903. Results and conclusion: The overall availability of pediatric medicines was 38.1% for public health facilities, 53.7% for private retail pharmacies and drug stores, 49.5% for private clinics and 48.3% for Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities. We found the illegal availability of prescription-only medicines of up to 54% in medicine stores. Medicine median prices were higher in the private clinics followed by retail pharmacies and drugs stores. CHAM had the lowest median prices for medicines of all the sectors. More than 50% of medicines were found to be affordable as less than a day’s wage was required to purchase the treatment. We found poor availability of pediatric formulation among public, CHAM, and private sectors in Malawi. This may affect the quality of care among pediatric patients and therefore contribute to morbidity and mortality in Malawi.

A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in private sector. However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment. The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents. Our study assessed availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets in selected districts during the implementation of copayment mechanism. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in in selected moderate-to-high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings. Following the World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs. Data were entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level. Results A total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey. One in seven (20/144: 95%CI: 9.1, 20.6) of the antimalarial agents in private drug outlets were quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACT). Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey. The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based. The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP). Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings. The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of ‘Green leaf’ ACTs (QAACT) and the recommended price (p<0.001). Predictors of availability of QAACT in private drug outlets include pharmacy drug outlet (aPR:0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.9) and dispensing price more than 3000UGX (USD 0.83) (aPR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.1, 0.51). Conclusion Quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in selected districts in Uganda. All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey. The dispensing price of QAACTs was significantly higher than the recommended markup price.

Access to medicines is recognized as an important determinant of treatment adherence. The access to glaucoma medicines and how it affects glaucoma management are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the availability, affordability, and accessibility of topical intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering eye drops in Haryana state of northern India using the World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International (HAI) methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done to collect data on prices and availability of glaucoma topical medications in public and private sector pharmacies and retail outlets using the WHO/HAI methodology between October 2021 and January 2022. The availability and affordability of topical glaucoma medicines was determined. Comparison of the local price with international prices was done by calculating the median price ratio (MPR). Results: A total of 191 facilities were randomly sampled across 11 (n = 55) urban, 29 (n = 92) semi-urban, and 44 (n = 44) rural places during the study period. The availability of topical medication for glaucoma was low (35.7 ± 22.3) across all sampled sites and all classes of topical glaucoma medications. The median price of topical medication and availability were negatively correlated, Pearson’s coefficient r (18) = -0.44, P 0.05, though the relationship was weak.

      "0                        Background Poor availability and unaffordability of key access antibiotics may increase antimicrobial resistance in the community by promoting inappropriate antibiotic selection and abridged therapy compliance. Objective To check the prices, availability, and affordability of the World Health Organization (WHO) key access antibiotics in private sector pharmacies of Lahore, Pakistan. Methodology A survey of WHO key access antibiotics from WHO essential medicine list 2017 was conducted in private sector pharmacies of 4 different regions of Lahore employing adapted WHO/HAI methodology. The comparison of prices and availability between originator brands (OB) and lowest price generics (LPG) were conducted followed by the effect of medicine price differences on patient’s affordability. The data were analyzed using a preprogrammed WHO Microsoft excel workbook. Results The mean availability of OB products was 45.20% and the availability of LPGs was 40.40%. The OBs of co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin and metronidazole and LPGs of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were easily available (100%) in all private sector pharmacies. Whereas, antibiotics like chloramphenicol, cloxacillin, nitrofurantoin, spectinomycin, and cefazolin were totally unavailable in all the surveyed pharmacies. The OBs and LPGs with high MPRs were ceftriaxone (OB; 15.31, LPG; 6.38) and ciprofloxacin (OB; 12.42, LPG; 5.77). The median of brand premium obtained was 38.7%, which varied between the lowest brand premium of 3.97% for metronidazole and highest for ceftriaxone i.e. 140%. The cost of standard treatment was 0.5 day’s wage (median) if using OB and 0.4 day’s wage (median) for LPG, for a lowest paid unskilled government worker. Treatment with OB and LPG was unaffordable for ciprofloxacin (OB; 2.4, LPG; 1.1) & cefotaxime (OB; 12.7, LPG; 8.1). Conclusion There is dire need to properly implement price control policies to better regulate fragile antibiotic supply system so that the availability of both OB and LPG of key access antibiotics should be increased. The prices could be reduced by improving purchasing efficiency, excluding taxes and regulating mark-ups. This could increase the affordability of patients to complete their antibiotic therapy with subsequent reduction in antimicrobial resistance.   \n",

There are concerns that unavailability and high prices of cancer medicines may limit patient access. Since information on availability, prices and affordability for cancer medicine is lacking for several countries, particularly for lower income countries like Ethiopia, it will be difficult to know the real situation of those medications' access. Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess availability, affordability and price of anti-cancer medications, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods The study was cross-sectional using a modified form of the WHO/HAI methodology of measuring medicine price, availability and affordability in public, private, Kenema municipal and Red Cross Pharmacies found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on the availability and price of 47 cytotoxic medications for both lowest priced generics and originator brands were collected in 3 public, 6 private and 2 NGO pharmacies which are expected to dispense cytotoxic medications in Addis Ababa. The data were entered and analyzed using WHO/HAI data entry and analysis form. Results were presented in tables and figures. Results The majority of the anti-cancer medications assessed were not available and the few available medicines were unaffordable. The lowest priced generic were relatively more available (34.8%) than the originator brand medications (2.8%) in the public sector. Generally, the availability of anti-cancer medicine differs when comparing the public, private and other sectors. The availability of cytotoxic medications was 18.8%, 5.3% and 8.8% in the public, private and other sectors. The prices of cytotoxic medications available in the private sector were higher than the public and other sectors. All of the medications except for anastrazole were unaffordable. Conclusion Medicines for cancer treatment are unavailable and the few available medicines are unaffordable in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Different interventions should be done to improve access to cytotoxic medications.   \n",

In order to introduce transparency in the private market the government introduced the Single Exit Price (SEP) for medicines in 2004, for all prescription medicines, comprising of a fixed ex-factory price with a logistics fee component (and value added tax) for medicines sold to all purchasers other than the State. This is complemented with a provision for an annual regulated maximum percentage increase. The study evaluates the impact of the SEP on a basket of originator medicines, in terms of costs, immediate price reductions and projected price reductions.MethodThis is an analytical, quantitative study. A basket of medicines was selected, based on the WHO/HAI list, and adapted to include registered medicines in South Africa. Prices of 50 originator medicines were assessed from 1999 to 2014 in terms of the single exit price and the changes in prices in accordance with legislation using a time series analysis methodology.ResultsOf the 50 originator medicines investigated 35 showed a statistically significant change in level. For the Global Core list, the percentage change ranged from 2.45–39.12% (mean = 19.87%, SD = 10.62%, IQR = 10.2%). The range for the Regional Core list was 1.77–42.17% (mean = 23.38%, SD = 12.43%, IQR = 15.65%). The Supplementary list was 11.68–55.86% (mean = 22.97%, SD = 16.26%, IQR = 17.34). This study indicates that the SEP regulation had an impact on medicine pricing in South Africa in both the short and long term. Most medicines investigated showed a smaller yearly increase in price compared to before regulations due to the controlled pricing environment introduced by Government.ConclusionThis study provides evidence of the impact of medicine pricing intervention from a middle–income country, and other developing countries looking at introducing medicine price controls can draw useful lessons.   \n",

Yet, because of increasing demands, many governments are now facing the dilemma of making essential cancer medicines available to all while keeping them affordable. Precise information about current access to these medicines is limited, and there's no systematic methodology in place to do so. Aim: To assess the availability and affordability of essential cancer medicines in Mexico, and compare their prices (public sector procurement and patient prices) against those in other countries of the region. Methods: We adapted the WHO/HAI methodology. We surveyed 21 public hospitals and 19 private pharmacies in 8 states of Mexico. Data were collected on the availability and prices of 49 essential cancer medicines (each strength and dose-form specific). Prices were compared against those in Chile, Peru, Brazil, Colombia and PAHO's Strategic Fund. Results: Of the various medicines, mean availability in public and private sector outlets was 61.2% and 67.5%, respectively. In the public sector, medicines covered by the public health insurance “People's Health Insurance” (SPS) were slightly more available. Only 7 (public sector) and 5 (private sector) out of 49 medicines were deemed affordable. Overall, public sector procurement prices were 41% lower than in other countries of the region. Conclusion: The availability of essential cancer medicines, in the public and private sector, falls below WHO's 80% target. The affordability remains suboptimal as well. A national health insurance scheme could serve as a mechanism to improve access to cancer medicines in the public sector.

      "7  Background: Essential medicines for children are those medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs of children. Access to essential medicines for children is a big challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Our study aimed to assess the accessibility of essential medicines for children in public sector in Sichuan Province of China, based on availability, affordability, and price. Methods: We adopted the modified World Health Organization/Health Action International (WHO/HAI) standardization methodology to measure the availability, affordability, and prices of 30 essential medicines for children in 20 public hospitals in nine regions of the Sichuan Province, China. Availability was expressed as the percentage of public medicine outlets that stocked surveyed medicines on the day of data collection, and prices were expressed as median price ratio (MPR). Affordability was assessed as the number of Sichuan Province’s daily wages required for the lowest-paid government unskilled worker (11.03 USD per day) to purchase one standard treatment of an acute disease or treatment for chronic disease for a month. Results: The mean availability of originator brands (OBs) and lowest priced generics (LPGs) were 9.7 and 46.5% in public sector. MPRs of only 3 OBs could be calculated, ranging from 0.55 to 13.37. MPRs of 18 LPGs ranged from 0.07 to 25.05. Among them, 2 OBs and 11 LPGs were priced at more than 1.5 times their international reference prices (IRPs) in public sector, most of which were injections. Except for cefazolin injection and ceftriaxone injection, most LPGs were affordable for the treatment of childhood diseases in public sector, as they each cost one or less than the daily wage for the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. Conclusions: Although the availability of LPGs for children was higher than OBs in public sector, the availability of children’s essential medicines was low in surveyed public sector in Sichuan Province, which was similar to previous studies in other provinces of China. The price of most medicines surveyed was higher than their IRPs in surveyed public sector, especially for some injections.
